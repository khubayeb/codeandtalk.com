    "description": "In 2012 we launched CartoDB with the goal of providing a set of tools and APIs that would allow for the easier development of spatial applications on a user experience-focused. At the same time, we provided users with an accessible editor for creating maps on the web. Now, we are looking at going one level deeper to make location intelligence more accessible and as a consequence, in July 2016, we launched CARTO Builder while rebranding the entire company to CARTO. This talk will be focused on how a big leap in the evolution of a product can drive big organizational innovation initiatives like a complete rebranding, and how you can accomplish such a big transformation in a 100 people company and 200k user base",
