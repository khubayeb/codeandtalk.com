During Drupal 8's development lifecycle we have seen many examples of how Drupal can be decoupled from the frontend, but very little on the backend.\n\nCome with me on a journey, as we answer the question \"Is Drupal 8 ready for microservices?\" and build a small prototype to demonstrate.\n\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/session/drupal-8-and-microservices",
