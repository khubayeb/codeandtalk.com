Drupal at 15\nRoom: Realityloop (Level 2)\nFri, 28-Oct, 13:15\nIntermediate - Inventing\nLee Rowlands\n\nDrupal as a project is now 15 years old.\n\nFrom humble beginnings it has grown to a very flexible framework that can interface and integrate with almost anything.\n\nBut at 15, is it suffering an identity crisis?\n\nThe presence of less technical forks like Backdrop suggests there are some growing pains.\n\nHow does Drupal reconcile its 'for everyone' philosophy with the level of complexity required to get started?\n\nIs Drupal trying to be too many things to too many people?\n\nCore itself seems to be suffering from this identity crisis, functionality like CMI is clearly designed for enterprise applications, yet there are modules in core like Block Place that seem to be aimed at less technical users.\n\nThis session will be run like a core conversation.\n\nThe presenter will lay out the conversation points for the first half of the session and then open the floor for discussion and input from attendees.\n\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/session/does-drupal-have-identity-crisis-drupal-15",
