Is it more than just post-it notes on a wall? Is it a conspiracy to sell sharpies? Aren't there apps we can use instead?\n\nKanban is an amazing tool, but many people only implement visualising work and forget the essentials that ensure their Kanbans get up and running with maximum efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nCome and learn the three essentials of Kanban that will help you:\n\n- Optimise the flow of work, whether you're in a team or wokring by yourself\n- How to identify blockages and waste\n- Why limiting work in-progress is important\n- The simple metrics that will mean estimating \"how long\" something will take becomes easy as pie!\n- Why physical over digital boards is vital to getting started\n\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/session/and-running-kanban",
