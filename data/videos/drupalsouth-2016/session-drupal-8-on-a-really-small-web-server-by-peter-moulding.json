You can build completely dynamic information signs and booths.\n\nPlus the Raspberry Pi has analogue and digital device connections for reading or controlling anything. Imagine a green information display showing the real temperature/humidity/sunlight at the display location. Add automated sun shades, fans, and other technology. Control everything from the Raspberry Pi. Add buttons and sliders to your Drupal Web site to control the devices through the Raspberry Pi.\n\nThe session includes:\n- Configuring a Raspberry Pi for development\n- Configuring a Raspberry Pi Zero for end use\n- Locking down the OS\n- Remote access for administration\n- Remote access for content updates\n- An introduction to the easiest analogue and digital hardware interfacing\n\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/session/drupal-8-really-small-web-server",
