    "description": "5 Times Go was Totally Perfect for BuzzFeed's API Gateway\n\nOver the past 18 months, we've transformed the way software is built and deployed at BuzzFeed. A major component in this evolution was the migration from a large monolithic application to a service-oriented architecture. Distributed systems with lots of moving parts have a distinct set of communication challenges such as authentication, rate limiting and request tracing. An API Gateway is a centralized approach to communication between services, providing tooling for these problems. After an initial release in Python, we recently rewrote our API Gateway using Go, because of its great concurrency features, performance, and robustness. \n\nJon Morehouse is an infrastructure engineer at BuzzFeed. Before falling in love with programming, he studied Aerospace Mechanical Engineering and Pre-med at the University of Southern California. These days, outside of work he spends most of his time cooking, exploring deep learning and building things in Go or Rust. You can find his open source contributions on GitHub.",
