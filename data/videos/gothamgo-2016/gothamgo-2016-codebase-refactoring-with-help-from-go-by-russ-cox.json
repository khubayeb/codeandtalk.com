    "description": "How Go can better help refactoring of the overall package structure of your code.\n\nRuss Cox has helped to create the Go Programming Language since 2008, when the language was still just a prototype. His work there started with the Go compiler and runtime, and developing Go's standard library. Today, he is a co-Tech Lead for the Go project and the Go team (a role he shares with Rob Pike).",
