    "description": "The CATME application was originally written in 2005 using mod_perl and MySQL.In 2012 we converted the application to use Postgres. A number of coding changes had to be made to support his change. Additionally, we inserted a number of bugs because we had unwittingly depended on MySQL's loose typing and acceptance of non-UTF-8 data and character encodings as UTF-8. This presentation examines the decisions and errors made.",
