    "description": "This tutorial looks at PostgreSQL logging and monitoring from the perspective of an overloaded system. You'll learn how to use the pgbench tool to generate difficult test workload. You'll see how to adjust logging on your server to spot common problems. And you'll get to see how real-time and historical monitoring tools can be used to find issues with your database and the server it runs on. This tutorial covers how to tune performance of a PostgreSQL system the hard way: starting when the performance problems are so bad the server is unresponsive, and you have no idea what's wrong.",
