Minsk, Belarus (1-Feb-2015)\nSlides: http://raimohanska.github.io/bacon-minsk-2015\nhttp://conf/rollingscopes.com\n\nJuha Paananen\nWith his 15 years of experience he has figured out something about the dos and don'ts of software development. Right now, functional programming seems to be one of the dos, while Javascript remains one of the musts. In particular, Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) seems to be a perfect fit for tackling the problems related to keeping a complex and highly asynchronous application codebase nice and readable. Juha is the author of Bacon.js - the FRP library for Javascript. He uses it at work every day to create modern web apps for his clients.",
