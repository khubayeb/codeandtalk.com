    "description": "This workshop will focus on all of the obstacles developers have to overcome on their path from \"but it worked on my machine\" to \"we roll out twice a day and still can sleep at night\": why and how to set up a Docker stack as development environment for eZ Publish; how to effectively deal with multi-environment configurations; what to put in a deployment script; how to manage updates to the database structure. If time allows: how to set up automated testing of an eZ Publish bundle on Travis.",
