    "description": "Forms are an ever-lasting topic in web development. Building them by hand is time-consuming. Building them with a library requires a library that is flexible enough to cover the many different use cases you will encounter. Symfony provides such a library that is proven and mature: The Symfony Form component. This workshop will teach you how to use version 3 of this component to build forms and combine them with a beautiful domain-driven design.",
