    "description": "Docker lets us run applications in isolated containers as a process on the host machine. As a result, it uses less resources and requires minimal setup. In my workshop, attendees will learn how to use Docker as a development platform for any PHP project. From building custom base images, to orchestrating the environment setup with docker-compose. From testing the code with different PHP versions, to testing with different software packages.",
