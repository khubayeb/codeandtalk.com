    "description": "An idea is usually under attack as soon as it takes its first breath: excuses why it won\u2019t work, warnings of how you\u2019re wasting your time, fear that it'll fail\u2013or even succeed. To move an idea from your brain into the world, it sometimes helps to be stubborn enough to ignore those who say your idea won\u2019t succeed, and naive enough to believe it will. I\u2019ll share some of my projects, from the silly to the serious, to show how stubbornness and naivet\u00e9 helped make them each a reality.\n---------------\n\nTalk & speaker bio:\nhttps://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2016/speakers/jeff-greenspan\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWatch this little recap video to get an impression how beyond tellerrand events look like:\nhttp://vimeo.com/69823900\n\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/btconf",
