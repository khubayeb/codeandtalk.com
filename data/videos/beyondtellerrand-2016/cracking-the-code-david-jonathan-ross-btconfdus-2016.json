    "description": "Reading a block of code is quite unlike reading a paragraph of text. Text is usually meant to be read, while code is meant to be scanned, parsed, edited, copied, pasted, tested, and debugged. As a result, the typography of programming is a relatively new and different typographic animal.\n\nDavid will examine a world of typography where letters squeeze and stretch to fit in fixed-width spaces, and where a missing semicolon can be the difference between celebration and catastrophe. He'll review the evolution of monospaced typefaces from typewriters to terminals, review stand-out contemporary monospaced designs, and share his experience creating Input, a superfamily of fonts designed specifically for code. Finally, David will share some thoughts on how we can continue to create richer environments for programming typography.\n---------------\n\nTalk & speaker bio:\nhttps://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2016/speakers/david-jonathan-ross\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWatch this little recap video to get an impression how beyond tellerrand events look like:\nhttp://vimeo.com/69823900\n\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/btconf",
