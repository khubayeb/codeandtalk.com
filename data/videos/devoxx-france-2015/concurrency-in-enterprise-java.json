    "description": "Concurrent programming in Java has been a hot topic long before Java 5. But could easily get you into trouble . Since then the Executor Framework and java.util.concurrent provide some more convenience but unfortunately not for Java EE developers. Up until Java EE7 introduced JSR236: Concurrency Utilities for Java EE. This session will introduce the benefits and gotchas of concurrent programming in Java EE by showing different scenarios we can make use of the new functionality in JSR236. This covers the topics of ContextualProxies, RxJava, ListenableFuture (Guava) and Java 8 Streams.\n\n\nAuthor:\nArun Gupta\nArun Gupta is Director of Developer Advocacy at Red Hat and focuses on JBoss Middleware.
