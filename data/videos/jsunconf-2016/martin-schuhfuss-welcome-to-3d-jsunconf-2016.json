    "description": "An Introduction to WebGL Introductions\n\nSlides: http://slides.com/martinschuhfuss/jsunconf-welcome-to-3d\n\nOne of the most complicated things about learning WebGL or 3D in general is the massive amount of very special concepts and terminology that are often unique to 3D rendering.\n\nKnowledge of these underpinnings is needed to understand documentation and code for any of the popular WebGL frameworks.\n\nThis talk will give you an introduction into how different rendering methods work, some terminology (how does the GL rendering pipeline work? wtf is a phong-material? what does a shader do?) and the mathematical concepts you need to know about (why are all these matrices?) to better understand how 3D works.",
