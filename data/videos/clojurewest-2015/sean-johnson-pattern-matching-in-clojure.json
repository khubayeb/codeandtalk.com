    "description": "Good Clojure practice emphasizes programming with immutable data. Another practice which can greatly simplify your code is declarative programming via pattern matching. Powerful pattern matching libraries such as core.match and defun give Clojure pattern matching abilities that rival Prolog and Erlang. This session is an experience report and best practices from extensive use of pattern matching libraries in recent open source Clojure projects.",
