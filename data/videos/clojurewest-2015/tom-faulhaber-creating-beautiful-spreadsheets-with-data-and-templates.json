    "description": "Programmers hate Excel, but we often have to deliver results as spreadsheets. This is what we miss: used correctly Excel is a tool of tremendous expository power that can enable richer communication.\n\nI'm going to show you what makes a spreadsheet beautiful and how you can create beautiful spreadsheets from pure Clojure data structures using the Excel templates library. Along the way, we'll discuss how to use spreadsheets to enhance understanding of quantitative data throughout our organizations.",
