    "description": "Arcadia is the integration of Clojure into the Unity 3D game engine and development environment. Unity exports to nearly all major gaming platforms, while Clojure's functional data and capacity for live programming and optimizing macros provide unique benefits to game developers. We will discuss progress since our last release, the internals of the Arcadia compiler, and the ramifications of industrial game development in Clojure, with live usage demos.",
