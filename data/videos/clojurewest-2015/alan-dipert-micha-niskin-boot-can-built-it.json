    "description": "Boot is a radically different JVM build tool written in Clojure. Where most build tools are their own environments, Boot is a library you can use on the JVM and within Clojure to automate builds the way you'd automate anything else: with programming. Boot is really easy to get started with and is growing in popularity. In our talk, we'll describe abstractions unique to boot, including pods, filesets, and tasks. We'll also demonstrate how they can be combined to solve complicated build problems in simple, straightforward ways, making new things possible and old things easy.",
