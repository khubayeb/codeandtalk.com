    "description": "As a community, we talk a lot about generative testing, especially in the small. What happens when we apply these approaches at the systems level? (Hint, it's Simulant!) In this talk, we'll explore how we applied Simulation Testing to a modern financial system. At the end, you'll have a cursory idea how to model and implement a simulation test for a multi-actor system.",
