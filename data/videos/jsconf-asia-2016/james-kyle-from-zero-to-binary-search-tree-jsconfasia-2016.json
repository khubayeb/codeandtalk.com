    "description": "We don\u2019t have a whole lot of data structures here in JavaScript world, but there\u2019s a whole world of super useful data structures out there. In this talk we're going to learn all about the fundamental data structures. Hash Tables, Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, and Binary Search Trees, we won\u2019t just learn them, we\u2019re going to build them. When we\u2019re done you\u2019ll be impressing all your friends with your mad structured data skills.\n\nJames is an engineer at Facebook as well as a core contributor to projects like Yarn, BabelJS and Lerna. Outside of work James is trying to make computer science more approachable to front-end developers.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 25+26 November 2016.\n\nSource: https://2016.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
