    "description": "Video from Reversim Summit 2016 http://summit2016.reversim.com/\n\nWe have a great market gap in Israel when it comes to product management. The demand for world class product management is strong as our ecosystem creates companies at a greater global scale, however the supply of great product management talent is weak. In this talk I will try to convert engineers to product managers as I believe it is one of the best levers to pull in order to solve the gap. I will explain how product managers make engineers' life miserable, how to excel at product management as an engineer and hopefully inspire engineers to solve one of the biggest gaps our ecosystem currently struggles with.",
