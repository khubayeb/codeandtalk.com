    "description": "WalkMe is a javascript module that integrates into web applications. Our module's performance (CPU and memory usage) is very important to us as it affects the hosting application. Measuring client side performance is not easy as there is usually a lot of noise that gets into the measurement. In WalkMe, we have built a system that can accurately measure our important performance metrics and visualize it in graphs. The system includes a JS profiler, Selenium based automation, an ELK service that stores the measurements and dashboards that visualizes the measuring in graphs.",
