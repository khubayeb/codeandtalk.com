    "description": "One of the main reasons developers and managers leave companies is lack of transparency. While most companies are all for transparency, very few manage to practice it. On this talk I'll cover different methods which all teams can easily adopt. Using dashboards, working better with Slack, internal podcast and even using democracy for some decisions. The talk will also focus on how to communicate business/ sales updates and how to handle 'bad' times.",
