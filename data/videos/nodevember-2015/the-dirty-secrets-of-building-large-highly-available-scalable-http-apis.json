    "description": "Damian Schenkelman\n&lt;p&gt;Most HTTP APIs sites show how to implement the GET /hello sample and provide a list of links that developers can use to get more information about different topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While those are definitely useful, large APIs that are to be consumed by other developers span a range of cross-cutting concerns that is hard to be aware of when you start to build them. In this talk we will go over some of these concerns, such as authentication, authorization, documentation, validation, rate limiting, geo-redundancy, and no downtime deployments, and will provide specific examples based on what we do at Auth0.&lt;/p&gt;",
