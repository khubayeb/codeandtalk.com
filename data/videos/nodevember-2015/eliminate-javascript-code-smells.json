Or have you written code and immediately knew that it wasn&apos;t good, but didn&apos;t know a better way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your JavaScript may pass JSHint, but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s legit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system&quot; --Martin Fowler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most developers can smell brittle and fragile code a mile away, but it takes time and training to combat against these smells.
