    "description": "Kassandra Perch\nThere are high points and low points to any career, but I think we can all agree very few of us work in a total vaccuum; using only code we and our teammates write, learning only by reading books, etc. At some point, you&CloseCurlyQuote;ll read a blog post, use an open-source library. We learn how to pull request, we share our side-projects: rarely anymore is our work entirely secluded from public eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of this are more staggering than you&CloseCurlyQuote;d think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This talk is about how our interactions with each other as people on the internet shape the world and culture we work in on a daily basis. It&CloseCurlyQuote;s about how we are encourging or destroying the next big thing&ndash; and what we can do to improve our chances. I&CloseCurlyQuote;ll use anecdotes from my own career, and stories borrowed with permission from others, to illustrate how we can change our culture, because we shape it with every interaction we have.&lt;/p&gt;",
