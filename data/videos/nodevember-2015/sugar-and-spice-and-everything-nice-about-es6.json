    "description": "Ben Ilegbodu\n&lt;p&gt;ECMAScript 6 is the new version of JavaScript making its way into our modern browsers and interpreters. Some of its features appear to be no more than a little syntax sugar &mdash; making development we already do in JavaScript a bit easier. Others add brand new functionality long missing in JavaScript, which allow us to spice up our code without having to include yet another library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experience with JavaScript will help you get the most out of this session, but you don&CloseCurlyQuote;t have to be a JS ninja to leave confident to begin using ES6 right now. Let&CloseCurlyQuote;s walk through all the sugar and spice of ES6 and what makes it just so nice. Along the way, you&CloseCurlyQuote;ll learn about arrow functions, modules, rest parameters, and other features. We&CloseCurlyQuote;ll also see strategies for how we can circumvent that pesky issue of cross-browser compatibility. Oh, and don&CloseCurlyQuote;t worry if you didn&CloseCurlyQuote;t understand any of those terms &mdash; you will after the session.&lt;/p&gt;",
