  "description": "A \"container\" is a group of process that are assigned computational resources and a private file namespace. In many respects a container is like a vitual machine; it can have its own IP address, memory, and root file system. But it is much faster to deploy and easier to work with that a traditional VM. In this talk I'll describe what containers are and the packaging mechanism to work with them (Docker). I'll give some demos and basic commands so you can get started using them yourself. All work is based off classes I teach in system administration and network security and a university in the USA. \n\n\nLinks:\nhttp://nosconf.github.io/",
