  "description": "Software Defined Networking (SDN) aims to decouple the network control plane from the data plane.. With SDN the control path of the switches resides in a central controller on a server and the data path continues to reside on the switch. SDN architecture is characterized by Separation of control plane from the data plane, A centralized control and view of the network, Programmability of the network by external applications. Such separation allows for more programmability and quick innovation at both layers. This presentation includes an introduction to SDN followed by some of challenges and opportunities therein.\n\nLinks:\nhttp://nosconf.github.io/",
