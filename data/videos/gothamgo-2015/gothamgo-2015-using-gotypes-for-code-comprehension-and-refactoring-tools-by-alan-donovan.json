    "description": "GothamGo 2015: Using go/types for Code Comprehension and Refactoring Tools by Alan Donovan\n\nFor Go 1.5, the standard library gained a new package. The Go type checker, go/types, is the foundation for several static analysis tools that can help Go programmers understand, navigate, and refactor their code. In this talk, Alan Donovan will demonstrate these tools and explain the concepts of the go/types API so that you can use it in your own projects. \n\nAlan Donovan is a Staff Engineer in Google's infrastructure division in New York, specializing in software-development tools. In 2005, he initiated and led the development of Google's proprietary build system, now open-sourced as Bazel, and has contributed to Google's production monitoring and cluster configuration tools. Since 2012, he has been working on the Go team, designing libraries and tools for static analysis. He is the author of the Go oracle, godoc -analysis, eg, and gorename tools, and is the co-author, with Brian Kernighan, of the forthcoming book The Go Programming Language . \n\nSee http://gothamgo.com/program#alan_donovan\n\nThis is a replacement (with better audio) of this earlier upload:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N381ubZTeo",
