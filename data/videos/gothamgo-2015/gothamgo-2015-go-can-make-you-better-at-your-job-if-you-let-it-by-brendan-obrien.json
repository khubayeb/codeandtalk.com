    "description": "Go is not-so-quietly asking us to make some serious changes to the way we programmers think about software architecture. Some of those changes go against long-held beliefs in the field of computer science. This talk outlines how Go's approach can be abstracted to help us be not just better programmers, but better at our jobs in general.\n\nBrendan O'Brien is the CTO of Ivy, a startup in the Fashion & Modeling industry. He's been writing Go for 3 years, or roughly long enough to make all the silly mistakes. When Brendan's not writing writing Go, he's thinking about the role programmers & technology play in the world. When he's not doing any of those things, he's working on this talk, or something else.",
