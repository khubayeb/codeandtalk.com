    "description": "Continuous Integration has rapidly become the de facto standard in software development processes. While functional and unit testing have proved relatively easy to integrate into these processes, performance testing has typically raised more challenges.\n\nIn this talk, we will examine key approaches to integrating performance testing into Continuous Delivery workflows, including how to overcome the key challenges of each method.\n\nUltimately, a true continuous delivery process relies upon the actualization of fully automated, configuration driven and version-based workflows, and we will show you how to evolve your CI system to facilitate this.",
