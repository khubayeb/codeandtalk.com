    "description": "For software developers or engineers game development is strange but familiar.  Straddling the worlds of software and entertainment, games development regularly encounters unexpected situations and trade-offs; bugs can improve the gaming experience and QA checks for fun and authenticity.  At Electronic Arts, our biggest projects leverage hundreds of team members located around the world, in nearly all time zones.  This presents interesting challenges, like when to do nightly builds or take an outage.  Come see how EA handles CM, CI, CD and Release Engineering and how Jenkins fits in to the picture.  Marvel at the scale of game development, shake your head at our problems/solutions and learn something in the process.  Come one, come all.",
