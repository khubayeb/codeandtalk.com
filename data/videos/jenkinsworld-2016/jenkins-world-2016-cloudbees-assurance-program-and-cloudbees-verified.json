    "description": "The CloudBees Assurance Program is an evolved delivery train that provides stable releases on a predictable schedule, while retaining enough flexibility so that major upgrade windows are wide enough for a broad range of policies. A key part of the program are CloudBees-verified components. The CloudBees-verified components are comprised of both the verified Jenkins core as an extension of the current Long-Term Support (LTS) lines, and a set of verified plugins, which is a translation of the same delivery model for a set of selected OSS plugins. This talk will present a guide through the benefits of the program and the main use cases, as well as insight into all the processes involved in making it a reality.",
