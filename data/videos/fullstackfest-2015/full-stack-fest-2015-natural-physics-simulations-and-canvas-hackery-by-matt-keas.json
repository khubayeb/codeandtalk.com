    "description": "Much of the attention these days in the client and serverside JS stack surrounds the use of various frameworks, tools, testing, performance, and the connected, streaming, reactive world of the web.\n\nThis talk is not about those topics above. Instead, this talk strips away all but the bare components and the raw curiosity one has for canvas drawings, simulations, animation techniques, DIY counter-culture.\n\nTechnical aspects of this talk will include: an introduction to some boilerplate code, game programming patterns and the game loop; an intro natural physics simulations in a 2d environment; and an intro to filter effects through canvas and WebGL shaders.\n\nhttp://fullstackfest.com/agenda/natural-physics-simulations-and-canvas-hackery\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)",
