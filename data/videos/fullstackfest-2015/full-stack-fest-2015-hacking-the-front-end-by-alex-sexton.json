    "description": "Most of the conventional web security wisdom revolves around the server, and often leaves the client out of the equation. Outside of \u201cescape user input\u201d a lot of developers don\u2019t know where to start with protecting their client-side applications. Unfortunately for everyone, there\u2019s a huge attack surface on the client-side, and it can sometimes feel like a hopeless goal to ever patch up all the holes. Let\u2019s go through a bunch of ways that you might not expect hackers will attack your site, and then let\u2019s see if there\u2019s anything we can do about it, including looking into exciting new standard APIs out of the W3C to help address these problems.\n\nhttp://fullstackfest.com/agenda/hacking-the-front-end\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)",
