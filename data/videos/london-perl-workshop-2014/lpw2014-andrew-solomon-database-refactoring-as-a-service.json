    "description": "Net-a-Porter has embarked on the mission of separating database refactoring from code deployment. The solution we've come up with is \"refactoring as a service\" and a soon-to-be released Perl module which drives it.\n\nI'll explain how Liquibase, our Git repositories, Puppet and Jenkins all fit together to make database refactoring easy and deployment safe and roll-backable.\n\nI'll also tell you how I just discovered Sqitch as a possible replacement for Liquibase.\n\n... and all within 20 minutes!",
