    "description": "Keynote: The Unfortunate Value of Failure By Ramsey Nasser\n\nRamsey Nasser is a Lebanese computer scientist, game designer, and educator based in Brooklyn. He researches programming languages by building tools to make computation more expressive and implementing projects that question the basic assumptions we make about code itself. His games playfully push people out of their comfort zones, and are often built using experimental tools of his design. A former Eyebeam fellow and a member of Kitchen Table Coders, when he is not reasoning about abstract unintuitive machines, he builds and maintains vintage motorcycles.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/KOxo/",
