    "description": "Step 1) Hack, Step 2) ?, Step 3) Profit By Bradley Herman\n\nHired's mission is to get everyone a job they love. As a transparent marketplace, Hired connects companies and engineers using technology and a personal touch. Initially a weekend hack project, it's grown to help thousands find their dream jobs/teams in 16 cities in 6 countries. From that origin, Hired has regularly focused efforts in hackathons, which have spurred much of the company's innovation.\n\nHiten & Brad will talk about their culture of empowerment, creativity, and trust and highlight several core features that have grown from small experiments to foundational parts of the experience.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/JYRR/",
