    "description": "Real World Docker for the Rubyist by Jason Clark\n\nDocker\u2019s gotten a lot of press, but how does it fare in the real world Rubyists inhabit every day?\n\nTogether we\u2019ll take a deep dive into how a real company transformed itself to run on Docker. We\u2019ll see how to build and maintain Docker images tailored for Ruby. We\u2019ll dig into proper configuration and deployment options for containerized applications. Along the way we\u2019ll highlight the pitfalls, bugs and gotchas that come with such a young, fast moving platform like Docker.\n\nWhether you\u2019re in production with Docker or just dabbling, come learn how Docker and Ruby make an awesome combination.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Jdj1/",
