    "description": "Making Money Disappear with Hash Functions! By Brendan Cordy\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin address? Where do all those weird letters and numbers come from!? Once we figure it out, we can dig deep between the cushions of the cryptocurrency couch and find lost coins claimed by bugs. You might think this would dissuade me from trying to generate addresses and transactions from scratch, but it didn't. Watch in horror as I put my own money at the mercy of my code.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/KWNq/",
