    "description": "How to Build a Skyscraper by Ernie Miller\n\nSince 1884, humans have been building skyscrapers. This means that we had 6 decades of skyscraper-building experience before we started building software (depending on your definition of \"software\"). Maybe there are some lessons we can learn from past experience?\n\nThis talk won't make you an expert skyscraper-builder, but you might just come away with a different perspective on how you build software.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/JkoX/",
