    "description": "Secrets of Testing Rails 5 apps by Prathamesh Sonpatki\n\nTesting Rails 5 apps has become a better experience out of the box. Rails has also become smarter by introducing the test runner. Now we can't complain about not being able to run a single test or not getting coloured output. A lot of effort has gone into making tests -- especially integration tests -- run faster.\n\nCome and join me as we commence the journey to uncover the secrets of testing Rails 5 apps.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/J5Ch/",
