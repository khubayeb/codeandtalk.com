    "description": "Ever felt jealous of \"other\" Ruby web frameworks whose applications can be run from a single file? Did you know Rails can do this too? Starting from a fresh \"rails new\" install, we'll gradually delete and pare away to find the beautiful, light, modular and object-oriented web framework underneath. Eventually we'll end up with a tweet-size Rails application! We'll learn about Rails' initialization process and default \"stack\", and investigate the bare-bones required to get a Rails app up and running.",
