    "description": "ActionCable for Not-Another-Chat-App-Please by Jesse Wolgamott\n\nRealTime updates using WebSockets are so-hot-right-now, and Rails 5 introduces ActionCable to let the server talk to the browser. Usually, this is shown as a Chat application -- but very few services actually use chats.\n\nInstead, Rails Apps want to be able to update pages with new inventory information, additional products, progress bars, and the rare notification. How can we make this happen in the real world? How can we handle this for unauthenticated users? How can we deploy this?\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/J5Ck/",
