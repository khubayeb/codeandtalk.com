    "description": "Chrome, Firefox, Node - even Microsoft Edge - all of these have added basic support for generators, but this area of JavaScript is still shrouded in mystery and inexperience. Generators allow developers to write functions which can be paused and resumed at will. When used well, this can create much simpler asynchronous workflows and avoid callback hell without the need for complex structures such as Promises. In this session we'll dive into generators and the 'yield' keyword to show attendees what they are, and more importantly why they should care! We'll look at some use cases and see just how these structures can be used to solve problems. Coming out of this session, developers will have a greater understanding of this new feature in ES6/2015 and what's coming next!",
