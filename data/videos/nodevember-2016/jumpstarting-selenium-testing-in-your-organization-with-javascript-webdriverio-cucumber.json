    "description": "With modern software development moving at a rapid pace, automation engineers may find it difficult to keep up with frequent changes. But if parts of the testing process are incorporated into everyone's workflow, this creates the potential for automated testing to mirror software delivery.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to make software testing more accessible to entire product and engineering teams by providing familiar tools that allow individuals to easily contribute to the automation process.\r\n\r\nFor this talk, I will explore how we can meet developers halfway by using the javascript-based testing framework WebdriverIO, demonstrate how product managers can create living documentation and test cases using Cucumber, and talk about sharing page objects and testing libraries across multiple services using NPM.",
