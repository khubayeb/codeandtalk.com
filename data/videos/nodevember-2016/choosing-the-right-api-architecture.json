    "description": "In this session you will learn about the most popular API architectures of today. You\u2019ll learn what Dr. Roy Fielding\u2019s REST actually is, and why it might be time to move on to newer architectures. You\u2019ll learn a little about the JSON API specification and its relationship to REST. Then of course we\u2019ll take a deep dive into both Netflix\u2019s Falcor and Facebook\u2019s GraphQL\u2014their similarities, their differences, and their tradeoffs from an unbiased developer.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this session you\u2019ll get a practical recommendation of which API architecture to adopt for your next project, in addition to knowing the problems all modern API architectures still share with a vision of the future for our API architectures.\r\n\r\nAn API will always at the center of our apps from now into the foreseeable future. A healthy API will benefit a development team immensely, but a poor API will only cost development teams. Knowing your API architectures is an important first step so you can make the best decisions from the beginning.",
