    "description": "Implementing interfaces in three dimensional space is the next great challenge for responsive design. This talk will start with an intro to the WebVR API and an overview of the current state of VR running in the browser. Then we'll dive into a discussion of example VR UIs. VR projects aren't meant to be viewed from one angle, so why should their interfaces be? Attendees will leave with a firm grasp of the possibilities and challenges faced while working on VR UIs as well as knowledge of tools and processes to get them up and running in this exciting domain.",
