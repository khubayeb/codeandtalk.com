    "description": "This talk will cover the ins and outs of building a javascript project using nothing but npm & bash.  No gulp or grunt at all.  I'll cover linting, mocha tests, babel, webpack and more.  I'll also cover how to use npm for versioning, deployment, publishing to npm, dependency management.  I've been using npm and node for over 3 years and have worked with and without grunt/gulp and I'm MUCH happier with just plain old npm & bash as it is easier to maintain and follow.",
