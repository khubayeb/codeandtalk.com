    "description": "As javascript developers, we rarely have to think about the memory usage of our apps. Consequently, we are often unclear of exactly what is going on under the hood for the most basic operations, like creating a variable, or comparing a couple of objects.  Together, we'll explore the details of some of these simple operations to get a better understanding of exactly how things are actually stored in memory and why.  I'll show some common _gotchas_ that we all run into at some point as well as share some tips for being an overall good citizen when it comes to memory usage.  Probably. Maybe. I mean that sounds pretty complicated. Actually, I might just talk about tacos.",
