    "description": "ClojureScript is a dynamic, functional, modern language that targets JavaScript. Reagent is a lightweight ClojureScript wrapper for React which allows you to write web applications easily. Because concurrency and immutability are baked into ClojureScript, representing and manipulating data is fun and easy. Attendees will be walked through the basic syntax of Clojure, basic types, how to declare variables and functions, a few built-in functions like `inc`, `map`, and `conj`,  basics of functional programming in lisp, and how to create Reagent components. Then we will walk through managing state with Reagent's `atom`, and finally finish up by creating a fully functioning example of a multi-timer! JavaScript and React experience is suggested, but not required.",
