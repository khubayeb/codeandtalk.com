    "description": "If you have read Michael Nygard's \"Release it!\" you know that a downstream service going down is just one of the many modes of failure that your new service will need to handle in production, and it is not even the worse one.\n\nTo make your system resilient, you also have to worry about networks going slow, disks getting full or third party services disappearing.\n\nBut how can we test those scenarios and make them part of our build pipeline?\n\nDuring the presentation you will learn how to create a Clojure test suite that will use Docker to automate your resilience testing.",
