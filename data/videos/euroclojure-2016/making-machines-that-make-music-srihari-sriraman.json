    "description": "Music synthesis is commonplace in Clojureland. However, modeling Carnatic (south indian classical) music, then generating and machine-learning it has been attempted by only a few, and is a very interesting problem to solve.\n\nThis talk is the story of my journey in bridging the gap between machine and human music. We will teach machines the fundamental concepts, create models that identify Carnatic music, and then build models that allow the machines to learn music themselves, and in the process, teach us.\n\nThe talk will (obviously) include demos of comparisons of machine and human (my) music, code snippets of implementation in Clojure/Overtone, and pretty melographs.",
