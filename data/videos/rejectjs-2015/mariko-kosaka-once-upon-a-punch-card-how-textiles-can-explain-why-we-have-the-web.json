    "description": "From a textile loom, to a teletype terminal, to a desktop computer, to the web; the stitches in your garment and the letters on your screen are both the result of operations executed on data.\n\nWhen I first learned to code websites, I took it for granted that img-tag displayed an image because it is a \u201cdigital photo.\u201d When I learned Node.js, saying \u201cuse Buffer\u201d and \u201ccreate a Stream\u201d became routine. But I never really understood what a \u201cchunk of data\u201d looked like.\n\nThen I started a craft project to convert digital graphics into knit patterns for an electric knitting machine. Little did I know, I was researching the origins of computing, data storage and digital communication: textile looms operated by punch cards. By knitting fabric, I learned to give instructions to a machine with just 2 signals. I discovered what a \u2018bit\u2019 really is, in my scarf! This physical, tactile experience with binary made everything in my JavaScript work much clearer.\n\nI\u2019d like to share my discovery process, and through some hacks and textiles give a friendly explanation about the \u201cworld of bits\u201d.\n\nhttp://rejectjs.org - http://twitter.com/rejectjs\nMusic by: https://soundcloud.com/7digits\nVideo by: http://wecap.de",
