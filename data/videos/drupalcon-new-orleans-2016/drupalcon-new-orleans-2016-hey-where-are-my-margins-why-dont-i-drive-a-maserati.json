    "description": "Your sales look great on paper. So why aren't you driving a Maserati and vacationing in Capri?\n\nIt's easy to get Drupal work (though getting more competitive every year) but running an Agency is hard. Getting operations and profit under control is a business owner's number one prioirity and headache! We'll explore the HUGE difference between running a cashflow business and a profitable one. With two turnarounds under by belt in the past three years and half a dozen more before that, let me share stories of how I bombed and what worked out well. I'll share strategies for hiring, firing, measuring and implementing tools while containing costs.\n\nGROWING a business is not the same as SCALING a business. A business that SCALES has value (think your golden parachute) a business that only GROWS is worth a multiple of its receivables. If you scale, you get to drive a Maserati!\n\nThis is a bigger picture of operations so a broader business view than Train Wrecks I and 2. If you're a company from 1-40 people and trying to figure out where your money is, you'll get some nice takeaways. Bring your thorniest biz issues. Your takeaways:\n\nGetting your CEO role right\nGetting the Right People on the Bus in the Right Seats\nAn Optimal Service Mix\nThe Right Process\nThe Right Tools for Data-Driven Ops\nMeasuring for Margins\nUnderstanding Cashflow vs. Profit\nSales/Estimating/Costing: Selling to the Service\nDevelopment: Touched on very lightly. See DrupalCon Amsterdam if you want more on running development profitably.\nIt's a lot to cover in one session. We'll get into the nitty gritty of how to make money in any business. This will be a fun session and I'm a good presenter, so no yawning here. Let's get your dream car in the works!",
