    "description": "Patch.com had a problem many would like to have after the first Powerball drawing: the Google juice was flowing so fast that standard datacenter links (~2gbps) were saturating. And, because links were maxing out, we couldn't even know just how much more capacity we needed for the next drawing. We had a couple days to prepare -- on a site that requires nearly instant invalidation to keep its content fresh.\n\nThere weren't many options we could turn around so quickly, so we talked to CDN providers and investigated other traffic-management options. It wasn't just an issue of getting a solution set up but also configuring, testing, and transitioning over with time to spare. This is the 48-hour story of surviving Google's catapult into the top 100 sites.\n\nIn this presentation, we will cover:\n\nServices and configurations you can deploy on short notice for site scaling, including costs and time-to-availability\nRunning HTTPS at scale (and avoiding man-in-the-middle attacks when communicating with the origin)\nConfiguring different cache lifetimes along the stack to allow precise invalidation control -- while still handling spikes elegantly\nOrigin shields: balancing geographic proximity with hitting the cache\nHow HTTP-standard Surrogate-Control headers manage differing cache lifetimes along the stack\nUsing Varnish's grace mode (in this case via Fastly) as a Plan B if the origin experiences issues\nAt each stage, making this all work well with Drupal's own cache invalidation hooks and header system",
