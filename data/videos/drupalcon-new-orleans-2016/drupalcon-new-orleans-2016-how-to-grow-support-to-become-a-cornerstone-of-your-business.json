    "description": "When we started our support program, it almost seemed like post-launch support was a dirty word in the community.  It was very easy to build a fancy Drupal site and walk away.  We noticed that the average end user can't really work a Drupal site that well. This led to a very simple question: how do we offer support to clients so they benefit and we make a profit?\n\nWe will go over many methods that have worked for us.  We will also talk about the methods we tried and failed at in the past four years of our Kalacare program. Topics will include, but will not be limited to:\n\nHow do you even find support clients?\nHow do you structure support (pricing, tiers, etc.?)\nWhat tools do you use to manage support?\nWho can fit the support role well and how do you help them succeed?\nHow do you offer different packages and how to sell them\nHow do you handle different types of support clients?\nHow do you convert support jobs to project-based work?\nJoin John Ouellet (Sr. Developer & Support Manager) and Katy Pool (Jr. Developer) of Kalamuna to find out how you can make support a cornerstone of your business. Questions are welcomed.",
