    "description": "Since the released of D8 with symphony and contrib module, everyone has been trying to contribute as much and as fast as possible. \nHowever the thought process has not yet moved to Drupal 8 style of coding (best practices not yet employed). The challenge here is the lack of design patterns in Drupal 7; where all modules designs were different.\n\nFor many the questions that pops up are: \"What is Services and Dependency Injection? How does it help me?\"\n\nThe way I see the answer to second question is \n\nIt enables us to reuse the functionality and make our services pluggable and replaceable.\nTo undestand and use best practices such as using service container in a decoupled manner.\n\nIn Drupal 8 We have many services and Dependency Injection Containers which give super powers to our Drupal 8 modules.\nIt's paramount that we understand and use them in Drupal 8 module development.\n\nMy session will talk about various scenerios and how can we use different services and Dependency Injection in these scenerios.\nThe session will include demos, examples and code walk throughs.\n\nHere're the objective of the session:\n\nOverview of Services and Dependency Injection?\nDrupal 8 core services and how to use them.\nHow to use Dependency Injection in a Drupal form?\nHow to use Dependency Injection in Contrib modules?\n\nWhat level of knowledge should attendees have before walking into your session:\n\nThis session will be easy to understand for people with intermidiate level knowledge of Drupal. However the session should be open for beginners.\n\nTake Away for attendees:\n\nBest practices of building custom and contrib module using services and dependency injection.\nHow to's for business logic of modules?\nUnderstanding of using DRY methodology.\nKeeping module in decoupled manner.",
