    "description": "In this session you'll hear the heroic tale of well-run machine helping a client in need to migrate a complex Sitecore site to Drupal in only 90 days.  We will share how we accomplished this: the methadology used to manage the process so that the site could be built even as the team was waiting on a 3rd party re-design, the specific complexities of the site--like configuring a CDN, integrating iframes with proprietary apps, and data migrations--and how the team efficiently worked through them, and how the team ultimately used Drupal solutions to solve the key Sitecore pain points of usability, responsiveness, and support.\n\nWe will also discuss how we accelerated development among the team, and testing with the client, to fulfill a very aggressive launch date to launch a professional, bug-free site.\n\nThis session is intended for audiences of all ages who have a basic understanding of Drupal.  We hope by the end of the session, you have learned a few new approaches to delivering complex, robust sites in compressed time-frames.\n\nNo animals were harmed during the creation of this presentation (unless you count people as animals...in which case a great many were flogged--mostly to boost morale, but sometimes just for fun).",
