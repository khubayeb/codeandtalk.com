    "description": "When definining the configuration of a system, different domain experts in your organization can bring their own skills and knowledge to mix together to create a delightful recipe for success. In this talk, I will demonstrate how to mix together the graham cracker of a sysadmin, the chocolate of an app dev, and the marshmallow of security to create a delicious treat that meets all the requirements for each discipline.\n\nWith the use of Test Driven Infrastructure and a Delivery Pipeline, you'll learn how each \"chef\" can add their portion of the camping delight, but still keep from dropping marshamllows into the campfire.",
