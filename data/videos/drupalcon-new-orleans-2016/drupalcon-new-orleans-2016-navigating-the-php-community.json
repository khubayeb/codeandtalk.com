    "description": "You've heard that \"Drupal is getting off the island\" but what does that mean? In this session, we'll map the greater PHP community so that you don't get lost. We'll look at major projects including frameworks like Laravel and Symfony, important tools to know like Composer and Packagist, finding online and offline PHP user groups and events, and explain community resources like the PHP-FIG, phptherightway.com and others. At the end, you'll know where to go when you're off Drupal Island.",
