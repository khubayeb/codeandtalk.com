    "description": "How do we design a CMS theme system that satisfies widely differing user personas at once? Is it possible to provide excellent user experiences for frontend developers, backend developers, and UI users at the same time? How do we balance flexibility, complexity, security, and other factors?\n\nWe will explore this problem space from several different angles:\n\nHow popular CMSes prioritize different user personas\n\nWhy the themer experience is more difficult in a CMS than a framework\n\nHow to evolve without losing backwards compatibility\n\nWhy security is an important part of designing a theme system\n\nHow we can improve the themer experience in the future\n\nAfter an introductory analysis we will open the floor to a discussion of these problems and potential solutions.\n\nSlides: bit.ly/goldnola2016",
