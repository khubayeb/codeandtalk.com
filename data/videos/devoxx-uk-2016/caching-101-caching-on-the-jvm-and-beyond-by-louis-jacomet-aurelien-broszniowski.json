  "description": "After numerous presentations on the JSR107, this in-depth 3-hour university session will twist the problem upside down. Instead of leading you through every aspect of the new Caching API for Java, we'll start from a real Java application, looking at its architecture, measure contention points and slowly start adding different caching patterns to it.\n\nWe'll look beyond the specification as well, not in terms of proprietary APIs, but in terms of different cache topologies (onheap, off-heap, distributed, ...) and what to consider when introducing caching to both an existing application or architecting a new one.\n\nFinally, we shall look at how different application containers and frameworks may affect decisions we've made during the session.",
