  "description": "Have you ever had an idea but struggled to get a working prototype created for it? Have you ever been to a Hackathon and struggled to know how to effectively create your vision in less than 48 hours?\n\nThis talk will take you through the journey of coming up with an idea, creating a user-story, designing the experience & interactions, creating a prototype and finally, publishing it to make it public - all within 15 minutes! Kaushik will take you through 10 steps that he prescribes to do this effectively and also, some of the do's and don'ts for each step.\n\nPrototyping is an art - it can help accelerate the process of your product development and also, help fine-tune the details from early on by wrapping up the prototyping with efficient user feedback-loop.",
