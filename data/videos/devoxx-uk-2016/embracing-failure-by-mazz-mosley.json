  "description": "I\u2019ve seen a lot over time in my tech career spanning over a decade, predominantly as a backend developer, then in operations and at various points along the sliding scale of leadership.\n\nTold in an anonymised story fashion, I\u2019m going to shine a light on some of the failures I\u2019ve experienced while working at various companies. I hope you can learn from my war stories and leave with ideas of how to mitigate and embrace failure, enabling you to learn from it.\n\nAll views are my own.",
