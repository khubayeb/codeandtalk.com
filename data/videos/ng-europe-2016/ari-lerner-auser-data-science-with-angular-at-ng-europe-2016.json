    "description": "Data is everywhere; it's in our apps,, servers, and all over the internet. It's the backbone for our applications. In this talk, we'll look at how data flows through our app and how to capture it efficiently in our apps. We'll look at methods for taking and processing data, interacting with it in our application, and ways to process it with JavaScript. We'll take a dive into the world of data science and visualization with Angular 2 to boot.",
