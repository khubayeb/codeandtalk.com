    "description": "La conf\u00e9rence est en fran\u00e7ais.\n\nEverybody is now using virtualization, containers are all the rage today, and microkernels start to gain traction\u2026 But how is all this working? How did these solutions come to be? What are the differences between containers and virtual machines? Where and why should you use docker, runc, rocket, kvm, xen, virtualbox, includeOS, rancherOS? This talk is a full session providing understanding on how these technologies work, how they compare to each other, and how you can put them to work. So, let\u2019s look under the hood, and understand how your system works (hint: it\u2019s not magic). And yes, it will be understandable even if you are not an OPS or an expert. That\u2019s precisely the point.",
