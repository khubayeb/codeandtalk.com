    "description": "Have you ever thought about what would happen if you lost your eyesight or your hearing? The world in general is a hostile place for people with disabilities. Those of us who do not have to deal with disabilities rarely think about what it must be like.\n\nAs developers, isn't one of our jobs making the world a better place, and doesn't that especially include making it better for those who have it the hardest?\n\nThe Web is powerful because anyone and everyone can access it and it can offer disabled users access to information and interaction that was never available before. And yet, because we assume that it must be difficult, we don't bother.\n\nBut accessibility doesn't have to be tough, it doesn't require learning a new set of tools. We can use the same tools that we already use, we just need to use them correctly and follow a few simple guidelines. And the best part, making your site accessible also improves usability for everybody else!\n\nWe will take a look at\n\naccessibility challenges when building dynamic web applications with Ruby on Rails (3 minute intro)\nunderstanding how usability is affected by disabilities (3 minutes)\nunderstand how Assistive tools work (3 minutes)\nand how we can use the best tools in HTML5, JS and in Rails to improve accessibility (22 minutes)\nQ&A\nThe focus of this talk will be on taking a Ruby on Rails application with extensive AJAX, and making it accessible. This will be a practical, code driven talk.",
