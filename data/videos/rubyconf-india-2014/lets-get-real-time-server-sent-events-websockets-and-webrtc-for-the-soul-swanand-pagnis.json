Polling creates additional HTTP overhead, is prone to latency issues and long polling is at best a hack. And don't we all love hate hacks!\nWith Server Sent Events, you can push data to the app whenever it's available, WebSockets are in fact bi-directional, full-duplex.\nWith this understanding, we will look at Server-Sent Events, WebSockets & WebRTC from a browser and server perspective. We will also look at all pieces we need to fit in, to get the big picture.\n\nAgenda\n\nConcepts and app Integration with:\nServer Sent Events\nWebSockets\nWebRTC\nRelated Open Source projects\nFurther reading, and opportunities to contribute and create\nHopefully questions\nKey Takeaways\n\nYou will:\n\nLearn the involved concepts\nSee relevant code from popular open source projects\nKnow where to look for further reading\nHave fun!",
