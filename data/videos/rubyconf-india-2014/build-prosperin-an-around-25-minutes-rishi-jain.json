    "description": "There were around 120000 ruby developers in the world 4 years ago. And the rate at which IT industry(particularly ruby and rails community) had grown in the past 4 years, it is safe to assume that this number would be much much higher, but lets proceed assuming 120000 ruby developers.As of 27-dec-2013 17:15 IST, there are 68,036 ruby gems available for download. So, the average number of ruby gem per developer comes out to be 0.57\n\nLets accept it, this is not a very impressive figure. So,what has stopped us from building gems and helping the ruby community grow? It could be one of the following reasons:-\n\n1.) Its like sending a space ship to Mars - complicated process\n\n2.) I can't do that, it's only for experts - calibre\n\n3.) Who has the time? I work 24x7 - busy\n\n4.) There are people already doing it, why should I work hard for it and open source it. I am not that crazy - lazy\n\n5.) Is it really needed, it's so trivial? - useless\n\nDuring the course of the talk, I am going to explain how ridiculously easy it is to build and publish a gem, what is the proper way of debugging a gem and how does building open-source software helps in your career growth? After this talk, I hope we all will try to improve upon the figure of 0.57 !!",
