    "description": "Rails was written in 2004, a time when RDBMS ruled the world and Pierce Brosnan was still James Bond! Today there's a plethora of NoSQL solutions gaining traction all around the world. Neo4J is the world's leading graph database. Written in Java, it serves some of the world's top companies and startups being 1000x faster than MySQL when it comes to deep joins. A graph database allows you to model your domain knowledge naturally as nodes connected by relationships, both of which can have an arbitrary number of properties and without the headaches of normalization and other RDBMS idiosyncrasies. ActiveGraph is a fast, minimal Ruby ORM for Neo4J written on top of Neon - slim ruby binding for Neo4J. ActiveGraph integrates with Rails bringing everything you know and love about ActiveRecord on board. I'll tell you how you can easily swap out ActiveRecord and slid in ActiveGraph without disrupting your applications and almost instantly gaining performance, productivity and scalability by over several times and I'll tell you why you should embrace and love graphs, maybe even marry them! We as a community need to build better tools so more and more people can embrace this new approach and technology for data modelling.",
