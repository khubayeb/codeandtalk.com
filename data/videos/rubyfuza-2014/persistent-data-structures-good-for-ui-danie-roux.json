    "description": "Persistent data structures are being imported from the FP world.\n\nWhat makes persistent data structures particularly interesting is that they cannot be modified in the traditional sense. These structures can model a timeline of changes quite naturally since every \"change\" creates a new \"copy\".\n\n\"Functional Reactive Programming\" is another old/new idea. FRP has a time centric viewpoint.\n\nHaving persistent data structures on the Javascript/UI side of the world unlocks a lot of the magic that FRP has to offer.\n\nIn this talk Danie will explain why persistent data structures are good and specifically why they are good for (the) UI.\n\nShot by Just Shoot Me Digital - http://www.jsmdigital.co.za/\nMusic is Coma's U Dub by Nokom electro - http://www.jamendo.com/en/track/39238/coma-s-u-dub",
