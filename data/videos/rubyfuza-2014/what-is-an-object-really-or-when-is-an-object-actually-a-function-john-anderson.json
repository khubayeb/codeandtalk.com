    "description": "Programming languages exist to allow programmers to make sense of complex real-world problems. What real world scenarios lend themselves to modelling by objects, and which to functions?\n\nThe first time I met objects was in Turbo Pascal in about 1990. I was completely baffled. I eventually got comfortable with objects in c++, and had that turned on its head by Smalltalk. Then Java objects came along and made me write too much code. Ruby was a breath of fresh air, but it took me 8 years before I really grokked the object model in Ruby. Lately with all the interest in functional languages, I've been glimpsing some overlaps between functions and objects.\n\nI'm still not sure if CLOS is a good idea though.\n\nAccompanied by real-world code examples in Ruby, naturally.\n\nShot by Just Shoot Me Digital - http://www.jsmdigital.co.za/\nMusic is Coma's U Dub by Nokom electro - http://www.jamendo.com/en/track/39238/coma-s-u-dub",
