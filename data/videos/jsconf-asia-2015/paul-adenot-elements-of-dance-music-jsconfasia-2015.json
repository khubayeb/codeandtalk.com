    "description": "Sound in general is a pretty abstract topic for most people. How can one generate and arrange what is, at the end, a simple sum of sine waves going through the air, and make people move on a dance floor?\nIn this talk, we'll deconstruct a prototypical acid-techno track, by live-coding all the sounds (modeled after old analog gear), from scratch, using the Web Audio API.\nWe'll cover the basics of sound sequencing, synthesis, with an historical background. And then we'll dance.\n\nPaul is an platform engineer at Mozilla, working on the Firefox web browser. He works on the Firefox Web Audio implementation, as well as the system audio code on all platforms. Sometimes help helps on WebRTC. He also co-edits the Web Audio API specification at the W3C, and dabbles in music production and cooking.\n\nJSConf.Asia - Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore - 19 November 2015.\n\nSource: http://2015.jsconf.asia\nSlides: https://github.com/padenot/jsconf.asia-15/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
