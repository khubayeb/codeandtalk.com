    "description": "Electroknit is a craft project to convert graphics into knitted patterns for an electric knitting machine. What does it take to turn a digital image into a physical object like a knitted sweater? The answer is series of image processing operations. As web engineer, we take it for granted that an img-tag displays an image because it is a \"digital photo.\" Let's look at what \"a Pixel\" is & how you can manipulate for fun with Canvas API & JavaScript.\n\nMariko is an engineer who loves data and knitting. When she is not making software at Scripto, she uses code to help her design textiles & organize local JavaScript meetup in New York City called BrooklynJS.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore - 20 November 2015.\n\nSource: http://2015.jsconf.asia\nSlides: http://kosamari.com/presentation/jsconfasia-2015/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
