    "description": "Introducing Spectrum (github.com/arohner/spectrum), a static \u201ctyping\u201d library that statically checks clojure code using standard clojure.spec annotations. While still early, spectrum is theoretically sound and can type-check itself. In this talk we\u2019ll cover how spectrum is implemented and why you\u2019d want to do such a thing. We\u2019ll discuss the tradeoffs of static typing vs. clojure.spec in a pragmatic, dogma-free environment.",
