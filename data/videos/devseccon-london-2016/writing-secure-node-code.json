    "description": "Some of the very things that make JavaScript awesome can also expose it to security risks. This talk will go through some sample security flaws unique to Node\u2019s async nature and surrounding ecosystem (or especially relevant to it). We\u2019ll show how these could occur in your own code or in npm dependencies. The talk will revolve around a sample vulnerable application, Goof, which we will exploit as an attacker would. For each issue, we\u2019ll explain why it happened, show its impact, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 see how to avoid or fix it.",
