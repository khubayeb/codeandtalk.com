    "description": "Many developers are working on web applications for the international audience. In such applications there are many details to be taken care of: translations, data formatting, handling input in different locales etc. As of today AngularJS has some supporting mechanism for writing truly global applications but the situation should dramatically improve in AngularJS 1.4 where a new translation service is worked on. This talk will walk you through i18n and i10n support available in AngularJS 1.3 as well as upcoming changes in 1.4 so you can confidently work on your applications that target global audience.\n\nSlides: https://pkozlowski-opensource.github.io/ngnl_02_2015",
