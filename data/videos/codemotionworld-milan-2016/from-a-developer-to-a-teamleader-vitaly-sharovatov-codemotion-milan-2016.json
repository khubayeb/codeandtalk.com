    "description": "Sometimes a developer faces the question or even a tough choice \u2014 should I become a teamleader or a manager? I cannot answer this question for anyone, but I can tell others what experience I had. I\u2019ve met two types of teamleaders in the industry \u2014 one that is more an architect and doesn\u2019t manage estimates or prioritisation, but is just responsible for the architecture and the code quality; and the second one that does both management and architecture. The latter one is the most interesting one, and is the topic of the talk.",
