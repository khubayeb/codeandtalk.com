    "description": "What if your surveillance drone could wake you up via a SMS in the middle of the night ? What if an interactive assistant could speak you the next CodeMotion session and give you directions ? Join this session to experience how to turn your data into engaging interactions. We'll show case an Innovative Drone demo, and an interactive Voice & Chat assistant for the CodeMotion event, then present the Cisco Spark & Tropo Cloud APIs. Want to try these by yourself ? pass by the codelabs where our technical mentors will help you ramp up and build your first Text to Speech and Bot prototypes.",
