    "description": "Software development is heavily influenced by many of the most common cognitive biases: technical choices are made following hypes (pro-innovation bias) or gurus (bandwagon bias); we create homemade tools instead of using de-facto standards (not-invented-here syndrome) and fix bugs without a full understanding of the problems (placebo bias) or even we pretend that there isn't any problem at all (ostrich bias). The first step to bring software development closer to an engineering discipline is recognizing this biases and admitting that we all suffer of them.",
