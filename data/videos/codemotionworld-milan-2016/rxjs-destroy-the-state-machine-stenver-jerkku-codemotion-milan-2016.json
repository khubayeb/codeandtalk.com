    "description": "Learn our story how we discovered RxJS, how it helped us to bring a massive state machine into an elegant event-based reactive platform. In this talk I am going to give you an overview of RxJS and why should you use it. I am going to talk about how once we adopted the reactive approach, it completely changed the way we think about state and state programming. All this with code examples.",
