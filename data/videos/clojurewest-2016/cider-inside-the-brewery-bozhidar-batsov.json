    "description": "A visit to CIDER's brewery where all the magic is happening. On this exciting journey you'll learn more about the current state and the future of the CIDER project. We'll examine recently added features and CIDER's next release. We'll also take some time to speculate about the future and we'll go over some of the more ambitious plans lying around in our cellar. But above else - we'll have some fun while doing so!",
