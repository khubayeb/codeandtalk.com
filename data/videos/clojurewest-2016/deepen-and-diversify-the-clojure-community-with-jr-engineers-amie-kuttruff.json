    "description": "The simplicity of the Clojure language and the supportive, collaborative spirit of its community played a pivotal role in my success as a junior engineer. I felt frustrated with cryptic 'method_missing' stack traces in my first years of programming, and Clojure reshaped the way I saw code and data. We will examine elements of the language that help and hinder newcomers, ways in which teams can better support junior developers, and how companies can create value by investing in upcoming talent. Living wage apprenticeships for developers can provide opportunities for a richer, more diverse tech industry.",
