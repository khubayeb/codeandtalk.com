    "description": "When writing Clojure or ClojureScript, it is very common to make use of data structures that are combinations of maps, lists, vectors, and other data structures. It is very common to query for nested elements in a data structure, or to transform only parts of a data structure. This kind of code tends to be highly nested, hard to follow, and error-prone. Specter is a library that gives you the power to write these queries and transformations concisely and elegantly - with performance rivaling hand-optimized code. In this session you will learn the basics of Specter and why it has near-universal applicability for Clojure and ClojureScript programming.",
