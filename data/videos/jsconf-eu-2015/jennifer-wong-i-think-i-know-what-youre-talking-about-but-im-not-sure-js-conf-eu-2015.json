    "description": "Recursion, instantiate, lexical scope - where do these words come from?! If you\u2019ve ever been in conversation with other developers and thought, \u201cI think I know what they\u2019re talking about, but I\u2019m not sure\u2026\u201d, you\u2019re not alone. Let\u2019s delve into the weird and wonderful parlance that computer scientists and developers have created for themselves. Whether the words are borrowed or just plain made up, I\u2019ll uncover how they made their way into the vocabulary of the modern programmer.\n\nIn this session, you\u2019ll learn everything from etymology to history to broader definitions, all of which can help you understand what the heck that person\u2019s rambling about. So, the next time you\u2019re in conversation, you\u2019ll be the one discussing dependency injection versus inversion of control with ease.\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte",
