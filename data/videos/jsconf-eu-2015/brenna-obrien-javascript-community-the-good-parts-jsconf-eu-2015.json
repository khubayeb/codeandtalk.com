    "description": "As front-end dev educator, my heart broke every time a student proclaimed \u201cI hate JavaScript.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve found the JavaScript community to be extremely positive and welcoming, but we can do better, especially if our newest colleagues aren\u2019t feeling the love. Let\u2019s talk about barriers to entry for new JS devs, both technical and non-technical, and let\u2019s talk about how we can help alleviate them. Learn how to be supportive and inspiring in your daily work, how to teach and explain JS concepts effectively, and how you, esteemed JS community member, can help end the laments of \u201cI hate JavaScript.\u201d\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte",
