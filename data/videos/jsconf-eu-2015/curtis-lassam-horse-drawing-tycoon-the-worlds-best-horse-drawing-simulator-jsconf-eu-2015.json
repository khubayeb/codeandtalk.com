    "description": "After a local VanJS meetup, my friends and I were tossing around project ideas. Someone referenced a website that would procedurally generate terrible ideas for video games. \u201cA tycoon game where you draw horses indefinitely\u201d.\n\nWhat a wonderful, terrible, awful idea for a game.\n\nIn this presentation, we go through the 1000 lines of Javascript and two weeks of drunken after-work coding required to produce the world\u2019s only horse drawing tycoon simulator, with Canvas, Twitter integration, the legendary HorseHash\u2122 algorithm, HorseCurrency\u2122, and HorseStamps\u00ae!\n\nYou\u2019ll pay for the whole seat but you\u2019ll only need the edge.\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte",
