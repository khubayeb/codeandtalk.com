    "description": "At the London Perl Workshop last year I got carried away and announced that I would write a book about modern Perl web programming. I promised that it would be ready by the next London Perl Workshop.\n\nThis talk is an update on the project. I'll also talk about some lessons that I've learned. And perhaps try to encourage other people to write new Perl books.\n\nThis will (hopefully) be updated from the version I'm giving in Granada this summer.",
