    "description": "We now live in a golden age where computational power has gotten so cheap, and so low energy that computers are now entering into everything.  We now have devices that can sit on your wrist for days alerting you to dynamic events, keep track of your motion and steps, connect to the wireless networks and report all this data, as well as bluetooth enabled pregnancy tests.  Lets explore this new world we are entering in both it's glory and it's bizzare, and realizing just exactly how much power we have both for good, and evil and how being open about things, hardware and software, can help us all.\n\nJohn 'Warthog9' Hawley",
