    "description": "Virtual Singers such as Hatsune Miku are very popular in Japan.  \nBefore that there was also an MBROLA-based Virtual Singer called Melissa and\na multilingual formant synthesizer called Virtual Singer by the French company Myriad.\nAll those Virtual Singers are based on proprietary software, until recently there was no free replacement. \nIn 2011 I discovered that the Music Technology Group had released their Spectral Modeling Synthesis library under the GNU GPL,\nand I decided to use that one in my own UTAU compatible resampler.\n\nTobias Platen",
