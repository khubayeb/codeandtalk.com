    "description": "tCache - Scalable data-aware Java  Caching.\n\nCaching data is an essential part in many high-load scenarios. A local 1st-level cache can augment a shared 2nd-level cache like Redis and Memcached to further boost performance.\nJCache (JSR107) is the Java Standard for Caching, and tCache is a production-proof OpenSource JCache provider.
