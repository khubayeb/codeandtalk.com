    "description": "Unit Testing, UI testing, UX testing, Functional Testing. These are day to day activities for me. And no, I am not a tester, I am a developer. A developer who cannot code without testing. In this presentation I want to share with you how, as a developer I have come to use tests for: understanding the features, choosing the best user experience design, choosing the best technical solution, implementing the features and test them, of course :). You will see practical examples of how tools like Jasmine, Spock, Geb are used for all the above types of tests. You will see a project with tests and we will discuss on how you can use testing effectively to enhance your professional performance.\n\nJoin me and you will see a happy developer because testing exists!\n\n\nCheck more at http://europeantestingconference.eu\nAll the videos from 2016 are at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF5ERStlaHg&list=PL_9ioxG4tU7sz_BwjPjHeLWr2CIoFNT10",
