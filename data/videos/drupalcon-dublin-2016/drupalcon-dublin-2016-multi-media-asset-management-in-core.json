    "description": "Media seems to be one of the hottest topics in the Drupal world at the moment. But what is \"media\"? From the past experience we concluded, that there are many different views on that. However, it seems that most of people include multi-media asset management from the perspective of the content creator when referring to it. This core conversation will focus on this part of \"media\".\n\nWe will check what we already have in core and what is happening in contrib space. Based on that we will explore what the possible paths forward from the core perspective are. Which contrib solutions are good candidates to be included? What is the realistic timeline for that?\n\nThe ultimate goal of this conversation is to create a general plan for the core part of the Media initiative.",
