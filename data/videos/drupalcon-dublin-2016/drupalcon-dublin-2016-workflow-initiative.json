    "description": "Announced at DrupalCon New Orleans by Dries, the Workflow Initiative is a planned Drupal 8 initiative to bring better content workflow tools into Drupal 8.2.0 and beyond.\n\nAt DrupalCon Dublin we will be days away from the 8.2.0 core release. This session will look at what we've been able to get into that release and how it plays with the contrib modules in this space.\n\nWe'll also be looking at the future of the initiative, the plan currently spans around 2 years with a wide range of features we feel core must, should, and could have.\n\nAs a Core Conversation, this session will be an active discussion, even though there is a plan it is actively evolving.",
