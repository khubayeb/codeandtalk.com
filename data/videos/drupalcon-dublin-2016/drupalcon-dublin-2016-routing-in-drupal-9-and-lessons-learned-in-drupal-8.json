    "description": "A lot of effort was spent in Drupal 8 converting code to use Symfony routes and to convert from a path-based identity for routes to a machine name (route name) based system.\n\nThis session will take a step back to see how that played out and where we stand now in 8.0.x. \u00a0Or perhaps to start a debate, we could frame it as\u00a0\"what happens when getting off the island means you got\u00a0bitten\u00a0by\u00a0sharks?\"\n\nThen, we will look ahead to Drupal 9 and consider\u00a0changes in direction, refactoring back to use paths, or\u00a0how we me might move even closer to Symfony.",
