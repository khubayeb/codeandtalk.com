    "description": "The Drupal ecosystem has lead the way in bridging communities. The project itself is now built on many technologies, libraries, and even more experiences. But has enough been done?\n\n\nThis talk will review the bridges our communities have. It will also look at some practical suggestions and solutions on how to look outside our comfort zones, widen our technical circles, and ensure that we learn from other people's mistakes whilst bridging the gap between communities. As a result, we can make our communities stronger and more diverse.",
