    "description": "JSON API is more than a specification that paints your bike shed. It prevents endless meetings about payload structures and query string parameters and puts the focus on the hard problems.\n\nIn this session you will learn to use JSON API to make complex requests that interact with data\u00a0like:\n\nGive me the cover image and the publication year of all the albums of all the bands having one of the members currently living in Murcia. Oh! And while you're at it, output the name of the band and that member as well.\nI'm sending a JSON document with the information about an article, its tags, its images and its author details. Let me know when you have created/updated all those entities and linked them together.\nAll this in a single HTTP request!\n\nTraditional REST implementations, including REST\u00a0in core, typically suffer from these different problems:\n\nToo many requests\u00a0are needed to get the whole data graph needed to construct the view in the consumer.\nThere is a significant response bloat\u00a0returning all the fields and relationships of every entity.\nListing and finding content based on the data attributes of the entities or their relationships.\nVersioning the API so consumers and back-end implementations can iterate separately.\nThere are several specifications in the wild that addess this problem in a very similar way because\u00a0the solutions\u00a0to these problems is known, being\u00a0GraphQL and JSON API the most prominent\u00a0ones.If you have had to build a decoupled app, or you have been working on progressively decoupled subsystems in your Drupal project (or you have been wishing to) this session is for you.",
