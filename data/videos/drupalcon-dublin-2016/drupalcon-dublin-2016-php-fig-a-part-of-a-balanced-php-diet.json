    "description": "The PHP Framework Interoperability Group (PHP-FIG) is 7 years old now. \u00a0Never heard of it? \u00a0That's too bad, because it's helping to change the face of the PHP universe.\n\nFIG is PHP's very own standards body. \u00a0It's goal is to improve collaboration, compatibility, and interoperability between PHP projects large and small. \u00a0Ever wondered why you don't have to think about autoloading anymore? That's FIG's doing. A common way to do logging for any project? \u00a0FIG's doing. \u00a0A standard abstraction for HTTP messages? \u00a0Yep, FIG.\n\nThis session will discuss this history of FIG, how it operates in its new structure, and how developers are benefiting from its work. \u00a0It will also explain how everyone, not just big projects, can get involved.",
