    "description": "I was excited by the improvements and shininess in Drupal 8, but then I found the enigmatic Typed Data API lurking beneath the surface of high-level functionality including the Field and Entity APIs. The Typed Data Manager remains one of the more elusive and esoteric services in Drupal 8, and stands on its own as powerful tool to model complex data types without the storage concern of the Entity system.\n\nDevelopers can leverage the Typed Data API in Drupal 8 components such as Serialization and Web Services.\n\nIn this session I will share how I leverage Typed Data covering the following topics:\n\nWhat was the equivalent in Drupal 6 and 7?\nWhat is a data type and data definition?\nWhat are the possible uses, advantages and disadvantages of Typed Data?\nHow do I unit test the Typed Data Manager monster?\nThe session is designed for experienced developers who are interested in data modeling and integrating with external services. Some familiarity with the Drupal 8 Plugin, Form, PHPUnit or Render API is assumed.",
