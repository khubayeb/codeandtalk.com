    "description": "Many Drupal agencies have remote workers. Some are entirely distributed. Whilst remote working is beneficial to all concerned in so many ways, it does come with its own challenges.\n\nThis talk will cover the journey I took when I moved from a typical 9-5 office job and joined Annertech, which is an entirely distributed Drupal agency. It will highlight the challenges I found: the good, the bad, the funny and the downright surprising, and offer as examples, my experiences for staying happy and healthy in what has the potential to be an isolating environment. We'll touch on things like: your setup, family, friends, office, ergonomics, physical wellbeing, mental wellbeing, motivation, pitfalls and strategies for successful remote working and living.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nI'm the lead support engineer at Annertech since 2014, and joined the company in 2011. I've been attending Drupalcons since 2009, doing Drupal since 2008, building websites since 1998 and mucking around in Basic on a Dragon32 since 1987. I've spoken at Drupalcamps and meetups in Ireland many times and before Drupal I toured around Ireland delivering technology training and around Europe playing heavy metal.",
