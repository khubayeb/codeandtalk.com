    "description": "We start out with a brief introduction to Bitcoin and the technology behind it. We present an overview of how Bitcoin has evolved, how it is used today, and how it is looking to evolve in the near future. We also explore some common misconceptions and criticisms that are raised against Bitcoin, specifically pertaining to scarcity and scalability. While some criticism is warranted, it fails to take into consideration that Bitcoin is not just Bitcoin. It exists in a closely interconnected network of several hundred technologies and communities that have sprung up in the wake of Bitcoin. Together they form what we call the cryptoeconomy space.\n\nIn the future we see this space evolving beyond money, eventually\nencompassing all types of value creation and transfer, such as liking\nsomeone on Facebook, transferring data to someone or getting recognition for being the first to invent a new technology. While it is impossible to predict which technologies will succeed, what is certain is that we are seeing a melting pot of technologies with 2014 investments surpassing that of Internet start-ups in 1995. Exciting years ahead!\n\nManuel Antonio Pettersen Lains has a master in nanotechnology and informatics and is a member of the central board of the Pirate Party in Norway. Christian Lains recently got his master's degree in philosophy. Together they run a startup blockchain technology company in Oslo.\n\nDownload video: https://fscons.org/videos",
