    "description": "The limitations of Bitcoin are partly technical, and partly due to the political economy of Bitcoin within the wider context of the current crisis in financial capitalism. However, blockchain technologies are promoted as enabling a lot of new potential solutions to current economic, social, and political problems. These changes and solutions will be considered critically within a framework of politics, ideology, sociology, economics -- and even economic and financial history thrown in for good measure.\n\nPatrice Riemens has been the Fellow of the Waag Society in Amsterdam, is a promoter of Open Knowledge and Free Software, has been involved as a \"FLOSSopher\" (a 'philosopher' of the Free/Libre and Open Source Software movements). He is also a member of the staff of Multitudes, and was a founding member of the Dutch Hacker Movement (\"Hippies From Hell\").\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Riemens\nhttp://p2pfoundation.net/Patrice_Riemens\nhttp://hippies.waag.org/\n \nDownload video: https://fscons.org/videos",
