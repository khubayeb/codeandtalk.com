    "description": "In Clojure, we have a language that is almost perfectly suited to constructing websites and APIs.\n\nIn this talk, I'll briefly summarize some features of the HTTP protocol which are not well known and rarely implemented, especially by services written in Clojure.\n\nI'll then introduce yada, a new Clojure library I've written that makes it easier to support more of HTTP in your web services, and explain the benefits of doing so.",
