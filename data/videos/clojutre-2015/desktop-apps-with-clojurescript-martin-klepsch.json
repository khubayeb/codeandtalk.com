    "description": "In this talk you will learn about the process, challenges and tools used to make a desktop application with ClojureScript based on Electron. Electron is an excellent target for ClojureScript and with a bit of tooling developing for it can be the pure fun we're used to from targeting plain browsers.\n\nElectron is a toolkit to create cross platform applications using web technologies. It allows you to build an application in the same way you would do it on the web while providing integrations with OS specific things like notifications and menus.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/mklappstuhl/desktop-apps-with-clojurescript",
