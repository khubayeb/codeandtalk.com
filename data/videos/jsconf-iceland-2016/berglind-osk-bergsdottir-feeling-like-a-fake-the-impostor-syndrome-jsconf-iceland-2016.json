Do you feel like your success is because of luck or timing but not your own skills? Then you are not alone! This concept is well known and is called the Impostor Syndrome. It's not limited to software development but it's very common in our field.\n\nMost people have experienced this at some point in their lives but don't talk about since they think they're alone.
