    "description": "Clojure tames state by casting it as a succession of values. We can think of spacetime this way too. An observer is merely an atom through which pass a succession of universes.\n\nWithin a process boundary we can use a Clojure atom to provide a single stable value. But what if we want to extend this boundary to the edge of the universe?\n\nToday, we have tools at our disposal to begin constructing such a thing: hashes, MVCC, Merkel trees and time-travelling databases.\n\nI will begin this talk by explaining these ideas and their expression in the juxt library Skippy McSkipface. I will end by demonstrating how these ideas can produce systems that respond quickly to change, e.g. responsive development environments and virtually instant live deployments.\n\nSlides: https://juxt.pro/talks/clojutre-2016.html#/sec-title-slide",
