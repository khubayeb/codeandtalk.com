    "description": "Business Insider estimates that by 2020 there will be 24 billion IoT devices connected to the Internet. McKinsey estimates that IoT has an economic impact between $3.9 to $11.1 trillion by the year 2025. I estimate that by the 2017 all IoT applications are written in Clojure. Or, at least they should be.\n\nWe have been implementing a simple proof of concept for an IoT solution for Flowrox. In this talk I explain the choices we have made and demonstrate why I think Clojure is ideal technology for IoT applications. I'll try to provide some ideas for both seasoned Clojurians and for newbies.",
