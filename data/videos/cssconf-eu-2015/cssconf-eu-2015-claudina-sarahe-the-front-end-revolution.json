    "description": "Claudina's talk explores events in the history of front end development that have lead to the bouleversement within the field. Despite what you might think, the revolution has nothing to do with the tools and technology. Twitter adoption isn't what started the Arab Spring; Node isn't responsible for JavaScript's renaissance; and Wikipedia's most significant accomplishment has nothing to do with the fact that they are one of the most visited, most trusted, human-powered sites.\n\nClaudina is an NYC-based entrepreneur, front end architect, tech event organizer, and speaker. She curates SassConf and runs the monthly NYC Sass meetup.\n\nhttp://2015.cssconf.eu/",
