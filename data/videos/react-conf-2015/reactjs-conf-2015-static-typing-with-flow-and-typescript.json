    "description": "Learn how to take advantage of static typing in React with Flow and TypeScript. Flow is a recently released static type checker from Facebook designed to work well with React from the ground up.\n\nTypeScript integration is more difficult and we will cover solutions to common problems such as class system integration and JSX. Both allow you to annotate your React application with types for compile-time checking of invariants and other common issues.",
