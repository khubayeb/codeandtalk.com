    "description": "Codecademy recently rebuilt our entire learning environment using React. The learning environment needs to dynamically accommodate various combinations of components (the code editor, browser preview, terminal, and lesson content, for example), leading to changing communication needs. We solved this using meta-programming to create dynamic communication \"adapters,\" allowing us to mix-and-match functionality on the fly. I'll discuss our motivations for doing so, and how this approach has met our needs for flexibility even if it's not the \"React way\" of doing things.",
