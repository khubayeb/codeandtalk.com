    "description": "Immutable data unlocks powerful memoization techniques and prohibits accidental coupling via shared mutable state. It's no accident that these are the the same benefits provided by React.\n\nPersistent data structures provide the benefits of immutability while maintaining high performance reads and writes and present a familiar API.\n\nLearn about how persistent immutable data structures work, and techniques for using them in your React applications with Immutable.js, a library of fully persistent immutable data structures.",
