{"description": "Pagination is an all-but ubiquitous element of UI design, yet you may find yourself re-inventing a pagination solution with each new Angular project. Faced with this problem, I wanted something I could drop in to any project, which would be as simple and intuitive as \"\"ng-repeat with page links\"\". I'll demonstrate my solution which makes powerful, flexible pagination as simple as adding a couple of lines to your HTML, with *no* extra code needed in your controller.\nYes, pagination is not exciting or cool, but you *will* need to use it, and this may make your life much simpler!\n\n(The module in question can be found at https://github.com/michaelbromley/angularUtils/tree/master/src/directives/pagination)\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/michlbrmly", "event": {"name": "ngEurope 2014", "nickname": "ng-europe-2015", "twitter": "ngEurope", "url": "https://2015.ngeurope.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-31", "filename": "paginate-anything-in-angularjs-by-michael-bromley-at-ng-europe-2014", "length": "04:59", "likes": "113", "recorded": "2014-10-22", "short_description": "Pagination is an all-but ubiquitous element of UI design, yet you may find yourself re-inventing a pagination solution with each", "speaker_twitters": " @michlbrmly", "speakers": {"michael-bromley": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Vienna, Austria", "github": "michaelbromley", "home": "http://www.michaelbromley.co.uk/", "name": "Michael Bromley", "twitter": "michlbrmly"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "ngEurope 2014", "nickname": "ng-europe-2015", "twitter": "ngEurope", "url": "https://2015.ngeurope.org/"}, "filename": "paginate-anything-in-angularjs-by-michael-bromley-at-ng-europe-2014", "recorded": "2014-10-22", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tASrOwMSfcg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Paginate anything in AngularJS"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tASrOwMSfcg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Paginate anything in AngularJS", "tweet_video": "Paginate%20anything%20in%20AngularJS%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/ng-europe-2015/paginate-anything-in-angularjs-by-michael-bromley-at-ng-europe-2014%20presented%20%40ngEurope%20by%20%40michlbrmly", "videos": [{"code": "tASrOwMSfcg", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "15940"}
