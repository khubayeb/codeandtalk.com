{"description": "When Twitter was faced with the task of re-architecting their backend away from a monolithic Ruby on Rails application to a series of microservices, they turned to Apache Mesos.\nMesos is an open source cluster manager that was developed at UC Berkeley and powers the backend of heavily trafficked services like Twitter, Siri and others.\nMesos has been proven to scale to tens of thousands of nodes.\n<p>\nUsing Mesos with container software like Docker and other open source tools, you can easily deploy automated infrastructure that scales with both your users and developers.\nIn this presentation, we will introduce and motivate the Apache Mesos project and demonstrate common workflows for building and deploying applications to a cluster of machines.\n\n", "event": {"name": "ScaleConf 2016", "nickname": "scaleconf-sa-2016", "twitter": "scaleconf", "url": "http://scaleconf.org/speakers/2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "sunil-shah-and-philip-norman-scaling-like-twitter-with-apache-mesos", "length": "47:46", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-03-10", "short_description": "When Twitter was faced with the task of re-architecting their backend away from a monolithic Ruby on Rails application to a seri", "speaker_twitters": " @philipnrmn @ssk2", "speakers": {"philip-norman": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Oakland, CA, USA", "github": "philipnrmn", "home": "http://philipnr.mn/", "name": "Philip Norman", "twitter": "philipnrmn"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "ScaleConf 2016", "nickname": "scaleconf-sa-2016", "twitter": "scaleconf", "url": "http://scaleconf.org/speakers/2016"}, "filename": "sunil-shah-and-philip-norman-scaling-like-twitter-with-apache-mesos", "recorded": "2016-03-10", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3qVOlzPvGhQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Scaling Like Twitter With Apache Mesos"}]}, "sunil-shah": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Berkeley, CA, USA", "github": "ssk2", "home": "http://www.geekonabicycle.co.uk/", "name": "Sunil Shah", "twitter": "ssk2"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "ScaleConf 2016", "nickname": "scaleconf-sa-2016", "twitter": "scaleconf", "url": "http://scaleconf.org/speakers/2016"}, "filename": "sunil-shah-and-philip-norman-scaling-like-twitter-with-apache-mesos", "recorded": "2016-03-10", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3qVOlzPvGhQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Scaling Like Twitter With Apache Mesos"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3qVOlzPvGhQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Scaling Like Twitter With Apache Mesos", "tweet_video": "Scaling%20Like%20Twitter%20With%20Apache%20Mesos%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/scaleconf-sa-2016/sunil-shah-and-philip-norman-scaling-like-twitter-with-apache-mesos%20presented%20%40scaleconf%20by%20%40philipnrmn%20by%20%40ssk2", "videos": [{"code": "3qVOlzPvGhQ", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "161"}
