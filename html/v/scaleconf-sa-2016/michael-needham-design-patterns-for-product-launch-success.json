{"description": "With more 'Unicorns' in the past 18 months than entire history of online 'Unicorns' the macroeconomic timing and techincal conditions for product disruption are high.\nThis talk will focus on 5 design patterns for rapid launch of new products and cost efficient scale when success takes hold.\n<p>\nThe more technical aspects of this talk will consider the serverless architecture paradigm (based on AWS Lambda) for low cost unit economics in your products and extremely high scale across global regions.\nIt will touch on frameworks such as Jaws Open Source framework (now called Serverless) as a mechanism of dealing with the complexities of such deployments, a typical challenge in this space.\nThe final design pattern focuses on scaling your products to new channels and will consider the IOT theme with a small example of a Lambda integration in to an Amazon Alexa for a simple beer ordering service.\n\n", "event": {"name": "ScaleConf 2016", "nickname": "scaleconf-sa-2016", "twitter": "scaleconf", "url": "http://scaleconf.org/speakers/2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "michael-needham-design-patterns-for-product-launch-success", "length": "44:10", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-03-10", "short_description": "With more 'Unicorns' in the past 18 months than entire history of online 'Unicorns' the macroeconomic timing and techincal condi", "speaker_twitters": " @smneedham", "speakers": {"michael-needham": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"github": "smneedham", "name": "Michael Needham", "twitter": "smneedham"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "ScaleConf 2016", "nickname": "scaleconf-sa-2016", "twitter": "scaleconf", "url": "http://scaleconf.org/speakers/2016"}, "filename": "michael-needham-design-patterns-for-product-launch-success", "recorded": "2016-03-10", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ozf5LaB6XZU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Design patterns for product launch success"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ozf5LaB6XZU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Design patterns for product launch success", "tweet_video": "Design%20patterns%20for%20product%20launch%20success%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/scaleconf-sa-2016/michael-needham-design-patterns-for-product-launch-success%20presented%20%40scaleconf%20by%20%40smneedham", "videos": [{"code": "ozf5LaB6XZU", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "50"}
