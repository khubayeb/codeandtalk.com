{"description": "I'd like to talk to everyone about someone we often neglect.\nThat someone keeps our code flowing into production, runs all those automated tests, does things that we might not even remember to deploy to all our environments.\n<p>\nThat someone is our build servers.\n<p>\nThey tirelessly work to get our changes to our end users and we do neglect them.\nWe don't treat our build servers like production servers, we hack them, we play with them, we mess up the environments.\nWe may have several agents with different runtimes and gems and patch levels and who knows what.\n<p>\nWe can do better.\n<p>\nIn this talk I'd like to take you through something I've been working on over the last couple of months: Containerising your build.\nThe tool I'll be using for this is Docker, but it's achievable with any VM or container technology.\nI'll take you through going from a working build on local to building local inside a container and then to moving that build to a build server, explaining what how and why as I go.\n\n", "event": {"name": "ScaleConf 2016", "nickname": "scaleconf-sa-2016", "twitter": "scaleconf", "url": "http://scaleconf.org/speakers/2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "dewald-viljoen-rapid-reproducible-builds-treating-our-build-servers-like-production", "length": "54:32", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-03-10", "short_description": "I'd like to talk to everyone about someone we often neglect.
