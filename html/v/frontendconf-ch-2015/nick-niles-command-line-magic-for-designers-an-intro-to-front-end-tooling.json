{"description": "As Flurin & Adrian Egger will certainly point out in their talk, designing for the web means being able to deliver more than just a PSD. Clients will expect to see what their site will look like on a variety of devices. And we designers can often save lots of time iterating on designs when that means simply changing some markup and CSS.\n\nWhen designing a website, it\u2019s important to be able to click things as early as possible\u2014and then iterate on that. Thankfully there are a slew of fantastic open-source tools which can help us get up and running.\nWith Assemble and Yeoman, for example, it\u2019s possible to scaffold a multi-page website in minutes. It\u2019s a great solution for projects ranging from prototyping a large CMS-based website to building a simple online styleguide.\n\nIf you\u2019re a designer and you\u2019ve been wanting to get comfortable with the command line, there\u2019s never been a better excuse to start.", "event": {"name": "Frontend Conference Zurich 2015", "nickname": "frontendconf-ch-2015", "twitter": "frontendconfch", "url": "https://frontendconf.ch/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "nick-niles-command-line-magic-for-designers-an-intro-to-front-end-tooling", "length": "46:37", "likes": "6", "recorded": "2015-08-27", "short_description": "As Flurin & Adrian Egger will certainly point out in their talk, designing for the web means being able to deliver more than jus", "speaker_twitters": " @NickNiles_", "speakers": {"nick-niles": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland", "github": "nickniles", "home": "http://nickniles.com/", "name": "Nick Niles", "twitter": "NickNiles_"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Frontend Conference Zurich 2015", "nickname": "frontendconf-ch-2015", "twitter": "frontendconfch", "url": "https://frontendconf.ch/"}, "filename": "nick-niles-command-line-magic-for-designers-an-intro-to-front-end-tooling", "recorded": "2015-08-27", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PGGFy4QqO58/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Command Line Magic For Designers: An Intro To Front End Tooling"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PGGFy4QqO58/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Command Line Magic For Designers: An Intro To Front End Tooling", "tweet_video": "Command%20Line%20Magic%20For%20Designers%3A%20An%20Intro%20To%20Front%20End%20Tooling%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/frontendconf-ch-2015/nick-niles-command-line-magic-for-designers-an-intro-to-front-end-tooling%20presented%20%40frontendconfch%20by%20%40NickNiles_", "videos": [{"code": "PGGFy4QqO58", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "349"}
