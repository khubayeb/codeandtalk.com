{"description": "In the last few years, we\u2019ve seen an emergence of a modular way of thinking about code and design. We\u2019ve seen the rise of SMACSS, BEM, and Atomic Design. This talk will look at those modular concepts and how they can streamline development for large and long-running projects. We\u2019ll also look at how these approaches can ease responsive design and development. Lastly, we will look at where the modular approach is going in the future as Web Components slowly make their way into browsers and application frameworks.", "event": {"name": "Frontend Conference Zurich 2015", "nickname": "frontendconf-ch-2015", "twitter": "frontendconfch", "url": "https://frontendconf.ch/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "jonathan-snook-modular-css-breaking-it-down-and-building-it-back-up", "length": "49:47", "likes": "5", "recorded": "2015-08-27", "short_description": "In the last few years, we\u2019ve seen an emergence of a modular way of thinking about code and design.
