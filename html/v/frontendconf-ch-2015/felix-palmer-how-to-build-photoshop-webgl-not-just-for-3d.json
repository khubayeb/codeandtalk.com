{"description": "WebGL is normally associated with 3D graphics, which can seem daunting without a background in this field. However, the WebGL API is inherently 2D, merely supplying a very useful toolbox of functionality for creating 3D engines. In this talk, we\u2019ll explore how WebGL can be used to manipulate 2D graphics, by creating a simple image editing application. Through live-coding we\u2019ll see that working with WebGL isn\u2019t all that complicated and a lot can be achieved without having to reach for higher level frameworks. We\u2019ll explore how hardware accelerated image effects like color changes, deformations or blurs can be implemented in a few lines of code.", "event": {"name": "Frontend Conference Zurich 2015", "nickname": "frontendconf-ch-2015", "twitter": "frontendconfch", "url": "https://frontendconf.ch/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "felix-palmer-how-to-build-photoshop-webgl-not-just-for-3d", "length": "51:55", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2015-08-27", "short_description": "WebGL is normally associated with 3D graphics, which can seem daunting without a background in this field.
