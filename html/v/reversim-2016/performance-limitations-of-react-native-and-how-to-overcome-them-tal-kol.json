{"description": "Abstract\nReact Native holds great promise in terms of excellent developer experience with Javascript and code reuse between platforms. The big question is\u200a \u2014 \u200ado these benefits come at the price of performance? How well can React Native hold its own against purely native implementations?\n\nBackground\nI\u2019ve been developing native mobile apps professionally for the past 7 years. I\u2019ve seen many magical \u201ccross-platform\u201d solutions but eventually nothing beats pure-native in terms of app quality. The main thing developers are skeptical of is performance. React Native is unique in its ability to achieve amazing performance, but it requires developers to understand what goes on under the hood. The aim of this talk is to ease concerns for new-comers and teach existing developers a few important guidelines.", "event": {"name": "Reversim Summit 2016", "nickname": "reversim-2016", "twitter": "reversim", "url": "http://summit2016.reversim.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-30", "filename": "performance-limitations-of-react-native-and-how-to-overcome-them-tal-kol", "language": "Hebrew", "length": "45:09", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-09-19", "short_description": "Abstract React Native holds great promise in terms of excellent developer experience with Javascript and code reuse between plat", "speaker_twitters": " @koltal", "speakers": {"tal-kol": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Israel", "github": "talkol", "home": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/talkol", "name": "Tal Kol", "twitter": "koltal"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Reversim Summit 2016", "nickname": "reversim-2016", "twitter": "reversim", "url": "http://summit2016.reversim.com/"}, "filename": "performance-limitations-of-react-native-and-how-to-overcome-them-tal-kol", "recorded": "2016-09-19", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VOBHQCQ9Xs4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Performance Limitations of React Native and How to Overcome Them (Hebrew)"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VOBHQCQ9Xs4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Performance Limitations of React Native and How to Overcome Them (Hebrew)", "tweet_video": "Performance%20Limitations%20of%20React%20Native%20and%20How%20to%20Overcome%20Them%20%28Hebrew%29%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/reversim-2016/performance-limitations-of-react-native-and-how-to-overcome-them-tal-kol%20presented%20%40reversim%20by%20%40koltal", "videos": [{"code": "VOBHQCQ9Xs4", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "150"}
