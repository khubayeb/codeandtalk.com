{"description": "Mal (Make-a-Lisp) is a Clojure-like Lisp language invented by Joel Martin for educational purposes. It has interpreter implementations in 56 programming languages, including C, Java and Python, but also Make, PL/SQL, Vimscript and many others.\nBuilding a Mal implementation is a great way to learn about Lisp in general and about the specific language you're implementing in. The talk will present the step-by-step process of building such an interpreter, incrementally adding features like variables, conditions, tail-call optimization and macros, finally reaching the last step which is capable of self-hosting (running the Mal interpreter which is written in Mal).", "event": {"name": "Reversim Summit 2016", "nickname": "reversim-2016", "twitter": "reversim", "url": "http://summit2016.reversim.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-30", "filename": "how-to-make-a-lisp-interpreter-in-56-languages-dov-murik", "language": "Hebrew", "length": "04:58", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-09-19", "short_description": "Mal (Make-a-Lisp) is a Clojure-like Lisp language invented by Joel Martin for educational purposes.
