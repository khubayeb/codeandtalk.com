{"description": "As programmers, we encounter stress in many forms: release dates, production bugs, hack even some code reviews can become stressful. I\u2019m pretty sure that everyone got his share of stress while working in the industry and experienced some of its negative effects on his physical and emotional wellbeing.\n\nThe thing about stress is that it slowly creeps in and sometimes we are not even aware of it\u2019s existence.
