{"description": "https://github.com/BorisKozo/subdivision\nSubdivision is a somewhat opinionated JavaScript library that helps you structure your code in a highly decoupled way. It is conceptually based on a battle proven Addin-Tree concept used in projects such as SharpDevelop (C#) but with a JavaScriptish flavor. I developed the library based on my experience working on both SharpDevelop and HPE VuGen while considering the special requirements one may have when developing a web application.\nThe library runs both in the browser and Node.js, is fully documented and has ~100% coverage in unit tests. Feel free to star/fork it on GitHub.", "event": {"name": "Reversim Summit 2016", "nickname": "reversim-2016", "twitter": "reversim", "url": "http://summit2016.reversim.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-30", "filename": "subdivision-a-tiny-library-for-building-highly-decoupled-and-modular-web-apps-boris-kozorovitzky", "language": "Hebrew", "length": "09:12", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-09-19", "short_description": "https://github.com/BorisKozo/subdivision Subdivision is a somewhat opinionated JavaScript library that helps you structure your ", "speaker_twitters": " @zbzzn", "speakers": {"boris-kozorovitzky": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Israel", "github": "BorisKozo", "home": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/boris-kozorovitzky-b6587b1", "name": "Boris Kozorovitzky", "twitter": "zbzzn"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Reversim Summit 2016", "nickname": "reversim-2016", "twitter": "reversim", "url": "http://summit2016.reversim.com/"}, "filename": "subdivision-a-tiny-library-for-building-highly-decoupled-and-modular-web-apps-boris-kozorovitzky", "recorded": "2016-09-19", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fZy1tO3SGW4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Subdivision - a tiny library for building highly decoupled and modular web apps (Hebrew)"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fZy1tO3SGW4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Subdivision - a tiny library for building highly decoupled and modular web apps (Hebrew)", "tweet_video": "Subdivision%20-%20a%20tiny%20library%20for%20building%20highly%20decoupled%20and%20modular%20web%20apps%20%28Hebrew%29%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/reversim-2016/subdivision-a-tiny-library-for-building-highly-decoupled-and-modular-web-apps-boris-kozorovitzky%20presented%20%40reversim%20by%20%40zbzzn", "videos": [{"code": "fZy1tO3SGW4", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "43"}
