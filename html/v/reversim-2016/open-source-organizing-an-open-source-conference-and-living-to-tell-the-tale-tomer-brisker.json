{"description": "August Penguin is the annual gathering of the Israeli Free and Open Source Software community. It has been occurring for most of the past 15 years, and is organized by volunteers in the Hamakor NGO. After several years in attendance and after taking part in similar conferences abroad, this year I decided to take an active part in organizing the event.\nThis talk will go over the story of how we organized the event, what mistakes we made and what lessons we learned. As an open-source, volunteer driven event, we had to handle different issues then those faced by commercial event organizers.\n\nHolding events is an important part of maintaining an active open-source community, and I hope to be able to help other organize successful events for their respective communities.\n\nThe talk will be relevant for people who organize events and wish to learn from our mistakes, as well as people who are part of open source communities, where coordinating with multiple volunteers is crucial.", "event": {"name": "Reversim Summit 2016", "nickname": "reversim-2016", "twitter": "reversim", "url": "http://summit2016.reversim.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-30", "filename": "open-source-organizing-an-open-source-conference-and-living-to-tell-the-tale-tomer-brisker", "language": "Hebrew", "length": "09:57", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-09-19", "short_description": "August Penguin is the annual gathering of the Israeli Free and Open Source Software community.
