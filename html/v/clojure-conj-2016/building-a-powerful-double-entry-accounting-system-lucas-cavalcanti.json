There is no room for money appearing or disappearing. A technique to avoid these problems is double entry accounting. In this talk we\u2019ll show how we built a double entry accounting system using Clojure and Datomic, functional programming with a little bit of algebra and generative testing. This system has proven to be the most powerful analysis tool, ensuring correctness and driving future predictions in a per-account basis.", "event": {"name": "Clojure/ConJ", "nickname": "clojure-conj-2016", "twitter": "clojure_conj", "url": "http://2016.clojure-conj.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "building-a-powerful-double-entry-accounting-system-lucas-cavalcanti", "length": "37:06", "likes": "17", "recorded": "2016-12-01", "short_description": "Money is a very important thing.
