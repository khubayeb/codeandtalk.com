{"description": "One of Clojure\u2019s strengths is its host interop, but sometimes you really want to call some C code. Perhaps you have a legacy .so/.dll you inherited; perhaps you\u2019re calling a video decoder or some cryptographic routines. This talk focuses on that interop, using a cryptographic library (caesium, which binds libsodium) as a specific example. It shows how Clojure can still leverage its strengths in this context, providing a significantly better environment for both R&D and general use compared to either plain Java or even other high-level C-centric programming environments like Python. This talks includes the mechanics of accomplishing this, lessons learned managing a real library used in production, and future efforts to make this process smoother for future programmers (e.g. manylinux1).", "event": {"name": "Clojure/ConJ", "nickname": "clojure-conj-2016", "twitter": "clojure_conj", "url": "http://2016.clojure-conj.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "using-clojure-with-c-apis-for-crypto-and-more-lvh", "length": "41:08", "likes": "15", "recorded": "2016-12-01", "short_description": "One of Clojure\u2019s strengths is its host interop, but sometimes you really want to call some C code.
