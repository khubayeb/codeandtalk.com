{"description": "Do you want to create robust and composable abstractions? Conal Elliott\u2019s Denotational Design is an iterative process to define the essence of a domain and build in composability. The resulting abstractions lead to more robust code at the core of your application and can give your business a competitive advantage. This is the process that created Functional Reactive Programming. We will apply this process to the Quil graphics library to develop a composable vector graphics system.", "event": {"name": "Clojure/ConJ", "nickname": "clojure-conj-2016", "twitter": "clojure_conj", "url": "http://2016.clojure-conj.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "building-composable-abstractions-eric-normand", "length": "38:59", "likes": "31", "recorded": "2016-12-01", "short_description": "Do you want to create robust and composable abstractions?
