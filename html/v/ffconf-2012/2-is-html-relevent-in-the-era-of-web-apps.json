{"description": "John Allsopp's talk at Full Frontal 2012\n\nWith the rise of web apps, the place of HTML, long the bedrock technology for web developers has become a little shakier. Widely used application frameworks like SenchaTouch and SproutCore effectively bypass HTML altogether, going straight from JavaScript to the DOM.\n\nSo is the era of HTML over? Or does it still have a place building web applications, as well as web pages?\n\nJohn Allsopp believes so, and in this presentation will consider in very practical terms why eschewing HTML in web application development may not be a great leap forward at all.", "event": {"name": "Full Frontal - ffconf 2012", "nickname": "ffconf-2012", "twitter": "ffconf", "url": "https://2012.ffconf.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "2-is-html-relevent-in-the-era-of-web-apps", "length": "40:38", "likes": "30", "recorded": "2012-11-09", "short_description": "John Allsopp's talk at Full Frontal 2012 With the rise of web apps, the place of HTML, long the bedrock technology for web devel", "speaker_twitters": " @johnallsopp", "speakers": {"john-allsopp": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Sydney, Australia", "github": "JohnAllsopp", "home": "http://johnfallsopp.com/", "name": "John Allsop", "twitter": "johnallsopp"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Full Frontal - ffconf 2012", "nickname": "ffconf-2012", "twitter": "ffconf", "url": "https://2012.ffconf.org/"}, "filename": "2-is-html-relevent-in-the-era-of-web-apps", "recorded": "2012-11-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KTqIGKmCqd0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Is HTML relevent in the era of web apps?"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KTqIGKmCqd0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Is HTML relevent in the era of web apps?", "tweet_video": "Is%20HTML%20relevent%20in%20the%20era%20of%20web%20apps%3F%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/ffconf-2012/2-is-html-relevent-in-the-era-of-web-apps%20presented%20%40ffconf%20by%20%40johnallsopp", "videos": [{"code": "KTqIGKmCqd0", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "2958"}
