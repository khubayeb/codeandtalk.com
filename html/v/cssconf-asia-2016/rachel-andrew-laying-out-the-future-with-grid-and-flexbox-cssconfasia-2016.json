{"description": "It is 2016. CSS is now 20 years old, and it has taken this long for us to get a true layout system designed for web pages and applications. A layout system, not based on hacking properties designed for something else entirely, but one that considers the reality of design for the web today. In this talk I\u2019ll introduce this new layout system, a system encompassing Flexbox, CSS Grid Layout and the Box Alignment Module. I\u2019ll explain how these standards get into browsers, and how you can start to take advantage of them sooner rather than later.\n\nRachel is a front and back-end web developer, author and speaker. Her books include the recent Get Ready for CSS Grid Layout and she is a regular contributor to a number of publications both on and offline. Rachel is co-founder of the CMS Perch, a Google Developer Expert and an Invited Expert to the CSS Working Group. She writes about business and technology on her own site at rachelandrew.co.uk.\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 24 November 2016.\n\nSource: https://2016.cssconf.asia/\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/rachelandrew/cssconfasia-laying-out-the-future\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
