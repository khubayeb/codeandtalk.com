{"description": "You may have heard about CSS Variables (aka CSS Custom Properties), but think it\u2019s not something you can use yet. Plus, you already have your preprocessor pipeline in place, why should you care? This talk will show how CSS Variables are much more powerful than static preprocessor variables and can be used today without compromising progressive enhancement. You will also learn several creative tips and tricks to take full advantage of them. As is customary with Lea\u2019s CSS talks, expect a swath of live demos to demonstrate the material.\n\nLea is currently busy doing research in Human-Computer Interaction at MIT CSAIL.\nShe has previously written a bestselling CSS book for O\u2019Reilly (CSS Secrets) and worked as a Developer Advocate at W3C.\nShe has a long-standing passion for open web standards, and is one of the few Invited Experts in the CSS Working Group.\nLea has also started several popular open source projects and web applications, such as Prism, Dabblet and -prefix-free and maintains a technical blog at lea.verou.me.\nDespite her academic pursuits in Computer Science, Lea is one of the few misfits who love code and design equally.\n\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 24 November 2016.\n\nSource: https://2016.cssconf.asia/\nSlides: https://leaverou.github.io/css-variables/#for-browser\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
