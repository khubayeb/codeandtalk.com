We would like to present our approach, what did and didn't work for us and have an open discussion about what worked for other groups and get input how we can improve.", "event": {"name": "FSCONS 2012", "nickname": "fscons-2012", "twitter": "fscons", "url": "https://fscons.org/2012/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "ellen-weber-silje-nord-station-x-encouraging-women-to-get-involved-in-our-hackerspace", "length": "37:10", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2012-11-09", "short_description": "Ellen Weber & Silje Nord: Station X - encouraging women to get involved in our hackerspace Download video: https://archive.org/d", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rk7OIXq04_8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Ellen Weber & Silje Nord: Station X - encouraging women to get involved in our hackerspace", "tweet_video": "Ellen%20Weber%20%26%20Silje%20Nord%3A%20Station%20X%20-%20encouraging%20women%20to%20get%20involved%20in%20our%20hackerspace%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/fscons-2012/ellen-weber-silje-nord-station-x-encouraging-women-to-get-involved-in-our-hackerspace%20presented%20%40fscons", "videos": [{"code": "rk7OIXq04_8", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "26"}
