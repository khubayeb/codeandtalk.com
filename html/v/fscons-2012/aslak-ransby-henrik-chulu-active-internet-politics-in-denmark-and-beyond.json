{"description": "Aslak Ransby & Henrik Chulu: Active internet politics in Denmark (and beyond)\n\nDownload video: https://archive.org/details/12SUN031200-active-internet-politics-denmark-and-beyond\n\nFounded in April 2011 Bitbureauet (\"The Bit Agency\") has become a central node in the public debate about internet politics in Denmark.\n\nThrough activism, lobbying and good, old-fashioned PR the Agency has been putting freedom of expression and information, privacy, network neutrality and free culture on the mainstream agenda in Denmark, where these subjects had so far been buried under an avalanche of anti-piracy activities such as DNS-blocking and anti-terror policies such as data retention.\n\nSo far, the activities of the Agency have peaked with the public manifestation against ACTA where up to 7000 (police figures) people took to the streets in Copenhagen, followed by the political rejection of the so-called \"letter model\", Denmark's light-version of three-strikes-and-you're-out.\n\nThe presentation will focus on practical experiences with political tactics and strategies for changing the course of internet legislation. We want to share what we have learnt so far, and get input from like-minded organizations and individuals.", "event": {"name": "FSCONS 2012", "nickname": "fscons-2012", "twitter": "fscons", "url": "https://fscons.org/2012/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "aslak-ransby-henrik-chulu-active-internet-politics-in-denmark-and-beyond", "length": "54:14", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2012-11-09", "short_description": "Aslak Ransby & Henrik Chulu: Active internet politics in Denmark (and beyond) Download video: https://archive.org/details/12SUN0", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AzWaigBG02Y/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Aslak Ransby & Henrik Chulu: Active internet politics in Denmark (and beyond)", "tweet_video": "Aslak%20Ransby%20%26%20Henrik%20Chulu%3A%20Active%20internet%20politics%20in%20Denmark%20%28and%20beyond%29%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/fscons-2012/aslak-ransby-henrik-chulu-active-internet-politics-in-denmark-and-beyond%20presented%20%40fscons", "videos": [{"code": "AzWaigBG02Y", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "52"}
