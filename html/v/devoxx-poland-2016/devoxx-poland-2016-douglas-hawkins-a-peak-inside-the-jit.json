{"description": "To get the most of out our applications and ourselves as developers, we must strive to understand our tools -- compilers included. Unfortunately, modern optimizing compilers are complex systems and understanding them can be a challenge. And, understanding the just-in-time speculative optimizing compilers inside JVMs can be even more daunting.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn about and see demos of many of OpenJDK's optimizations . By seeing these optimizations in action and more importantly learning how these optimizations fit together, you'll learn how to work with the JIT to make your code and you more efficient.", "event": {"name": "Devoxx Poland 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-poland-2016", "twitter": "devoxxpl", "url": "http://devoxx.pl/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "devoxx-poland-2016-douglas-hawkins-a-peak-inside-the-jit", "length": "50:45", "likes": "2", "recorded": "2016-06-22", "short_description": "To get the most of out our applications and ourselves as developers, we must strive to understand our tools -- compilers include", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6ICU2xo427M/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Devoxx Poland 2016 - Douglas Hawkins - A Peak Inside the JIT", "tweet_video": "Devoxx%20Poland%202016%20-%20Douglas%20Hawkins%20-%20A%20Peak%20Inside%20the%20JIT%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/devoxx-poland-2016/devoxx-poland-2016-douglas-hawkins-a-peak-inside-the-jit%20presented%20%40devoxxpl", "videos": [{"code": "6ICU2xo427M", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "249"}
