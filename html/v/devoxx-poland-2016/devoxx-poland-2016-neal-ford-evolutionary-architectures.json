{"description": "For many years, software architecture was described as the \u201cparts that are hard to change later\u201d. But software architecture is the balancing of capabilities versus constraints. If build changeability one of your prime capabilities, evolutionary change becomes easier. The microservice architectural style is quite popular, but it is only one in a family of evolutionary architectures. This session defines the characteristics this family of architectural styles, along with engineering and DevOps practices necessary for implementation. I cover the principles behind evolutionary architectures, the practices needed for success, how organization and team structure affects these architectures, and specific engineer practices that facilitate evolutionary architectures. I also discuss migration strategies from common existing architectural types towards move evolutionary architectures.", "event": {"name": "Devoxx Poland 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-poland-2016", "twitter": "devoxxpl", "url": "http://devoxx.pl/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "devoxx-poland-2016-neal-ford-evolutionary-architectures", "length": "50:43", "likes": "5", "recorded": "2016-06-22", "short_description": "For many years, software architecture was described as the \u201cparts that are hard to change later\u201d.
