{"description": "Common libraries. Almost every company makes them. Why do they often end up hated for becoming hard to maintain garbage? Does it have to be this way? Can we do better?\n\nIn this talk we'll explore various models of providing shared code for an organization and their consequences. We'll also dive into the art of designing and developing libraries \u2013 keeping them powerful and easy to use despite constant changes in requirements. We'll cover API design, handling of dependencies, deciding on features, structuring the tools ecosystem and much more. All this coming from experience (and mistakes) of building tools for the microservices infrastructure at Allegro.\n\nI hope to leave you with practical knowledge essential for building successful tools \u2013 both for growing internal commons ecosystems and for creating useful open-source projects.", "event": {"name": "Devoxx Poland 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-poland-2016", "twitter": "devoxxpl", "url": "http://devoxx.pl/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "devoxx-poland-2016-piotr-betkier-building-common-libraries-and-not-failing-at-it", "length": "51:05", "likes": "4", "recorded": "2016-06-22", "short_description": "Common libraries.
