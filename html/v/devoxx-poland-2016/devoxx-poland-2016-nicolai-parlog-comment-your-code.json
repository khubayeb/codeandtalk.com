{"description": "You think your code is so clean that it doesn't need any comments? Or are your colleagues convinced that all comments are failures? Then this talk is for you!\n\nLet's first dispute some common arguments against commenting code: Comments lie? Tests are better? Good names suffice? We'll find fault with all of them (and more)!\n\nWith that out of the way we'll categorize comments and analyze their costs and benefits. This will give us the means to discuss the end: Which comments will improve a code base?\n\nOf course, every team has to come up with its own answer. But the vocabulary and ideas presented in this talk can help find it.", "event": {"name": "Devoxx Poland 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-poland-2016", "twitter": "devoxxpl", "url": "http://devoxx.pl/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "devoxx-poland-2016-nicolai-parlog-comment-your-code", "length": "50:48", "likes": "13", "recorded": "2016-06-22", "short_description": "You think your code is so clean that it doesn't need any comments?
