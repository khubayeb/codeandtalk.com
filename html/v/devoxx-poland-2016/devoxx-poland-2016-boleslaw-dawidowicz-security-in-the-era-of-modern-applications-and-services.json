With the raise of mobile and client side apps, (micro) services and APIs it has become a fairly complex topic. At the same time with security breaches hitting the news on the monthly basis it is everyone's concern. Being an area every developer or architect needs to understand very well.\n\nThankfully a number of modern standards and solutions emerged to help with current challenges.
