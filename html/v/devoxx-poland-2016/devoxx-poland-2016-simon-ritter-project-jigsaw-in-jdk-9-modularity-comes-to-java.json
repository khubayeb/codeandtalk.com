{"description": "Project Jigsaw will bring modularity to the Java platform; something that will enable better security, performance and flexibility for deployment of applications. This talk will look at the fundamentals of how modularity in Java will work. Developers will need to understand that these changes go significantly further than just separating the standard class libraries into a number of discrete units.\n\nThis talk will explain the impact project Jigsaw will have on developers in terms of building their applications, as well as helping them to understand how things like encapsulation will change in JDK 9.", "event": {"name": "Devoxx Poland 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-poland-2016", "twitter": "devoxxpl", "url": "http://devoxx.pl/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "devoxx-poland-2016-simon-ritter-project-jigsaw-in-jdk-9-modularity-comes-to-java", "length": "49:41", "likes": "19", "recorded": "2016-06-22", "short_description": "Project Jigsaw will bring modularity to the Java platform; something that will enable better security, performance and flexibili", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PY0jZyBmOr4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Devoxx Poland 2016 - Simon Ritter - Project Jigsaw in JDK 9: Modularity Comes To Java", "tweet_video": "Devoxx%20Poland%202016%20-%20Simon%20Ritter%20-%20Project%20Jigsaw%20in%20JDK%209%3A%20Modularity%20Comes%20To%20Java%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/devoxx-poland-2016/devoxx-poland-2016-simon-ritter-project-jigsaw-in-jdk-9-modularity-comes-to-java%20presented%20%40devoxxpl", "videos": [{"code": "PY0jZyBmOr4", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "1203"}
