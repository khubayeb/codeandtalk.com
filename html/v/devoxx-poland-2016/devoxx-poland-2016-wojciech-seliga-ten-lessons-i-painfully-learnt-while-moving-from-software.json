{"description": "For many years I was a software developer. I would concentrate on the code, software projects and the interactions with my closest team and the users. I was sure that Agile solves all world\u2019s problems. I would laugh over Scott Adam\u2019s Dilbert comics with his Pointy Hair Boss. Life was simple, life was good. Now for 8+ years I have been running a software company, not a small one anymore. I became myself a full-time boss who only codes sometimes at home or during hackathons. This session is about sharing with you those critical lessons which I painfully learnt when trying to grow into this new role - transitioning from being a software engineer into being an entrepreneur and top manager. Wheres not all of the lessons may or will (if you dream about your own startup) apply to your case, being aware of them may save you tons of time, energy, money or even help you to avoid the total disaster - burying your own company, dreams or destroying your team. And after all, sharing war stories from the past is fun \u2026 when these stories are the past.", "event": {"name": "Devoxx Poland 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-poland-2016", "twitter": "devoxxpl", "url": "http://devoxx.pl/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "devoxx-poland-2016-wojciech-seliga-ten-lessons-i-painfully-learnt-while-moving-from-software", "length": "54:30", "likes": "22", "recorded": "2016-06-22", "short_description": "For many years I was a software developer.
