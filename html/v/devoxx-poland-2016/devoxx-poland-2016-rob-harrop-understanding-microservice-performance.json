{"description": "The world at large seems sold on microservices as a way to build large, quality systems at the speed needed to compete in today's market. However, microservices are not without their downsides, one of which is the difficulty of reasoning about and optimising the performance of mircoservices working in tandem.\n\nIn this session, attendees will learn the key concepts needed to measure the performance of their services, identify potential bottlenecks and take corrective action to ensure services perform as needed.\n\nBefore we can reason about the performance of connected services, we must understand how to reason about services in isolation. The first half of the session is dedicated to discussing how to measure service performance correctly, what metrics matter and how to compare the performance of a service over time.\n\nIn the second half of the session, we take our single-service knowledge and expand it out to reason about a set of services working together to provide some aggregate function. We'll see how the performance of each service affects the performance of the whole, and learn how to identify where to focus our optimisation efforts.", "event": {"name": "Devoxx Poland 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-poland-2016", "twitter": "devoxxpl", "url": "http://devoxx.pl/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "devoxx-poland-2016-rob-harrop-understanding-microservice-performance", "length": "47:43", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-06-22", "short_description": "The world at large seems sold on microservices as a way to build large, quality systems at the speed needed to compete in today'", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GpG9_emteuY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Devoxx Poland 2016 - Rob Harrop - Understanding Microservice performance", "tweet_video": "Devoxx%20Poland%202016%20-%20Rob%20Harrop%20-%20Understanding%20Microservice%20performance%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/devoxx-poland-2016/devoxx-poland-2016-rob-harrop-understanding-microservice-performance%20presented%20%40devoxxpl", "videos": [{"code": "GpG9_emteuY", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "161"}
