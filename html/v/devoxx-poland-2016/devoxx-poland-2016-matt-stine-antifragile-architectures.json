{"description": "What is fragile? Fragile things are easily broken, damaged, or destroyed. When faced with stressors, they crumble. Then what is the opposite of that? Many of us would answer something like \u201crobust\u201d or \u201cresilient.\u201d Things that maintain their integrity when faced with stressors. But it\u2019s possible that we\u2019re wrong.\n\nIn his book Antifragile, Nassim Nicholas Taleb challenges this idea by inventing the word that forms the book\u2019s title. Antifragile is the true opposite of fragile. Whereas fragile things are easily broken, damaged, or destroyed when faced with stressors, antifragile things improve, become stronger, or become more powerful when faced with stressors.\n\nCan we build software systems like this? Dick Gabriel explores the idea of ultra-large scale systems that self-regulate (and in fact thrive) in the face of unexpected changes and stressors in his essay \u201cDesign Beyond Human Abilities,\u201d and Russ Miles explicitly calls out the idea of Antifragile Software in his book by the same name. During this session we\u2019ll explore these ideas and what they mean to us as developers and architects.", "event": {"name": "Devoxx Poland 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-poland-2016", "twitter": "devoxxpl", "url": "http://devoxx.pl/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "devoxx-poland-2016-matt-stine-antifragile-architectures", "length": "43:38", "likes": "4", "recorded": "2016-06-22", "short_description": "What is fragile?
