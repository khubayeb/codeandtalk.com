{"description": "Gather round and hear the harrowing tale of how Chris saved his Chickens from the evil raccoons using Clojure on a BeagleBone Black to automatically shut and lock the coop door at night and open it in the morning, using ambient light sensors to ascertain the time of day. Learn what it took to get Clojure running on the BBB, what some of the challenges were, and how Clojure handled for device programming. Get a sneak peak of libraries being extracted from this project, which you'll be able to use for general purpose device programming. Bask in glorious victory with Clojure and the dancing chickens.", "event": {"name": "Clojure West 2015", "nickname": "clojurewest-2015", "twitter": "ClojureWest", "url": "http://clojurewest.org/speakers-2015"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "christopher-small-how-clojure-saved-my-chickens", "length": "23:43", "likes": 0, "recorded": "2015-04-20", "short_description": "Gather round and hear the harrowing tale of how Chris saved his Chickens from the evil raccoons using Clojure on a BeagleBone Bl", "speaker_twitters": " @metasoarous", "speakers": {"christopher-small": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Seattle WA, USA", "github": "metasoarous", "home": "http://www.metasoarous.com/", "name": "Christopher Small", "twitter": "metasoarous"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Clojure West 2015", "nickname": "clojurewest-2015", "twitter": "ClojureWest", "url": "http://clojurewest.org/speakers-2015"}, "filename": "christopher-small-how-clojure-saved-my-chickens", "recorded": "2015-04-20", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0EQMrpZb7-Y/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "How Clojure Saved My Chickens"}, {"event": {"name": "Clojure West 2016", "nickname": "clojurewest-2016", "twitter": "ClojureWest", "url": "http://clojurewest.org/"}, "filename": "datalog-all-the-way-down-christopher-small", "recorded": "2016-04-15", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aI0zVzzoK_E/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Datalog all the way down"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0EQMrpZb7-Y/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "How Clojure Saved My Chickens", "tweet_video": "How%20Clojure%20Saved%20My%20Chickens%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/clojurewest-2015/christopher-small-how-clojure-saved-my-chickens%20presented%20%40ClojureWest%20by%20%40metasoarous", "videos": [{"code": "0EQMrpZb7-Y", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "2142"}
