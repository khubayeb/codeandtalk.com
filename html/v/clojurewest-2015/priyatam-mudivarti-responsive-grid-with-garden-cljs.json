{"description": "Clojurescript community has been slow to embrace Garden, a simple library for rendering CSS in Clojure/ClojureScript. Conceptually similar to Hiccup, Garden allows you to design pages and layouts like a functional programmer: plain-old data structures, functions, and abstractions.\n\nIn this talk I will focus on responsive grid techniques popularized by Bootstrap, Susy, Flexbox, followed by a live-coding session. We will explore how to implement fluid, responsive, nested, and even DIY grids with Garden, and render CSS3 on the server or client. We will end with a demo of a page designed in Garden, rendered with Om, to showcase the benefits of using Clojurescript all the way.", "event": {"name": "Clojure West 2015", "nickname": "clojurewest-2015", "twitter": "ClojureWest", "url": "http://clojurewest.org/speakers-2015"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "priyatam-mudivarti-responsive-grid-with-garden-cljs", "length": "37:53", "likes": 0, "recorded": "2015-04-20", "short_description": "Clojurescript community has been slow to embrace Garden, a simple library for rendering CSS in Clojure/ClojureScript.
