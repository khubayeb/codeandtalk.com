It's exciting, but it's moving so fast that it can be overwhelming to keep up with. This talk is a refresher on what ReactJS is, and why it is a good fit for ClojureScript. It concludes with a survey of the three primary CLJS interfaces to React (Om, Reagent and Quiescent) and provides code samples and walkthroughs of example applications, comparing and contrasting the different approaches.", "event": {"name": "Clojure West 2015", "nickname": "clojurewest-2015", "twitter": "ClojureWest", "url": "http://clojurewest.org/speakers-2015"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "luke-vanderhart-the-reactjs-landscape", "length": "41:04", "likes": 0, "recorded": "2015-04-20", "short_description": "ReactJS!
