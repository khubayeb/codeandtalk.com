{"description": "Zelkova is a library for Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) that lets you compose your Clojure or ClojureScript application as a graph of \"signals\" defined using pure functions. It is heavily inspired by Elm, a language which embraces an innovative flavour of first-order FRP as its central paradigm.\n\nThis talk will show Zelkova in action, demonstrating how it can be used together with GUI libraries like Om and Reagent to solve practical problems while making state management unexpectedly fun.", "event": {"name": "Clojure West 2015", "nickname": "clojurewest-2015", "twitter": "ClojureWest", "url": "http://clojurewest.org/speakers-2015"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "james-macaulay-composing-interactive-apps-with-zelkova", "length": "41:37", "likes": 0, "recorded": "2015-04-20", "short_description": "Zelkova is a library for Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) that lets you compose your Clojure or ClojureScript application a", "speaker_twitters": " @jamesmacaulay", "speakers": {"james-macaulay": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Toronto, Canada", "github": "jamesmacaulay", "name": "James MacAulay", "twitter": "jamesmacaulay"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Clojure West 2015", "nickname": "clojurewest-2015", "twitter": "ClojureWest", "url": "http://clojurewest.org/speakers-2015"}, "filename": "james-macaulay-composing-interactive-apps-with-zelkova", "recorded": "2015-04-20", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rOKOCAkHNYw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Composing Interactive Apps With Zelkova"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rOKOCAkHNYw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Composing Interactive Apps With Zelkova", "tweet_video": "Composing%20Interactive%20Apps%20With%20Zelkova%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/clojurewest-2015/james-macaulay-composing-interactive-apps-with-zelkova%20presented%20%40ClojureWest%20by%20%40jamesmacaulay", "videos": [{"code": "rOKOCAkHNYw", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "2517"}
