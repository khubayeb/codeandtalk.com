{"description": "This talk will introduce the cloxp Clojure development kit. Cloxp aims to combine ideas first found in some of the original Smalltalk and Lisp environments with the possibilities of a modern web-based infrastructure. The tool is build around the fact that Clojure provides rich runtime and meta-programming facilities that enable a highly interactive workflow. Instead of being focused on a file-centric development approach, code exploration, modification, and versioning happens on the level of code entities.", "event": {"name": "Clojure West 2015", "nickname": "clojurewest-2015", "twitter": "ClojureWest", "url": "http://clojurewest.org/speakers-2015"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "robert-krahn-programming-clojure-smalltalk-style", "length": "39:40", "likes": 0, "recorded": "2015-04-20", "short_description": "This talk will introduce the cloxp Clojure development kit.
