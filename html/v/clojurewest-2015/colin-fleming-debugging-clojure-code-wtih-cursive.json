{"description": "Debugging Clojure code has traditionally been something of a black art. Cursive provides a complete JVM debugger based on the one provided in IntelliJ, including breakpoints, stepping and expression evaluation. In this talk, we'll see some of the features that Cursive provides to make debugging easy and discuss some tricks and tips for debugging Clojure code. We'll also discuss the JDI that the debugger is based on, and how some of its limitations affect debugging functional languages.", "event": {"name": "Clojure West 2015", "nickname": "clojurewest-2015", "twitter": "ClojureWest", "url": "http://clojurewest.org/speakers-2015"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "colin-fleming-debugging-clojure-code-wtih-cursive", "length": "41:14", "likes": 0, "recorded": "2015-04-20", "short_description": "Debugging Clojure code has traditionally been something of a black art.
