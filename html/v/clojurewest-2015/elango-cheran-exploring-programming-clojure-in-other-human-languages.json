{"description": "While the software industry contemplates how to increase diversity in its ranks, what if Clojure could be the very tool to spread Clojure (and programming in general) to the world of non-English speakers? By seriously considering the macro perspective, we can see how simple ideas can lead to opportunities for lasting change. How far could we extend these efforts in Clojure-esque simplicity? Find out what makes Clojure uniquely suited to supporting other human languages.", "event": {"name": "Clojure West 2015", "nickname": "clojurewest-2015", "twitter": "ClojureWest", "url": "http://clojurewest.org/speakers-2015"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "elango-cheran-exploring-programming-clojure-in-other-human-languages", "length": "17:13", "likes": 0, "recorded": "2015-04-20", "short_description": "While the software industry contemplates how to increase diversity in its ranks, what if Clojure could be the very tool to sprea", "speaker_twitters": " @elangoc", "speakers": {"elango-cheran": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"name": "Elango Cheran", "twitter": "elangoc"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Clojure West 2015", "nickname": "clojurewest-2015", "twitter": "ClojureWest", "url": "http://clojurewest.org/speakers-2015"}, "filename": "elango-cheran-exploring-programming-clojure-in-other-human-languages", "recorded": "2015-04-20", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MqjMZNwnYCY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Exploring Programming Clojure In Other Human Languages"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MqjMZNwnYCY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Exploring Programming Clojure In Other Human Languages", "tweet_video": "Exploring%20Programming%20Clojure%20In%20Other%20Human%20Languages%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/clojurewest-2015/elango-cheran-exploring-programming-clojure-in-other-human-languages%20presented%20%40ClojureWest%20by%20%40elangoc", "videos": [{"code": "MqjMZNwnYCY", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "1567"}
