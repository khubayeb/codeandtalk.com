How can the choice of programming language inform game design and empower the artist? What properties of lisp, and Clojure in particular, make it suitable for building games? This talk will start by considering the wisdom of our ancestors before diving into an exploration of the application of functional programming as engineering practice to the art of game design.", "event": {"name": "Clojure West 2015", "nickname": "clojurewest-2015", "twitter": "ClojureWest", "url": "http://clojurewest.org/speakers-2015"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "morgan-mullaney-well-i-wouldnt-want-to-make-a-dysfunctional-game", "length": "18:18", "likes": 0, "recorded": "2015-04-20", "short_description": "Perhaps contrary to popular belief, there is a rich history of lisp and other functional languages in game development.
