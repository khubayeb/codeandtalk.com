Elasticsearch also makes a very interesting complement to Drupal, pushing what can be done regarding search functionality, but it doesn't stop there. Elasticsearch also goes beyond search, and enables us to manage and understand massive amounts data,\u00a0both structured and unstructured.\n\nHere are some examples of functionality we have built which we'll cover:\n\nFast, interactive search interfaces that guide users with smart autocompletion\nContext-sensitive ranking for improved relevancy\nInterfacing Drupal with massive amounts of structured data that wouldn\u2019t performantly fit in Drupal\nUnderstanding and visualizing large amounts of data\u00a0\nSearching content with language-aware text analysis\nEffective handling of saved searches and notifications with percolators\nFor each example we will look at the challenges from conception to concrete implementation details,\u00a0giving\u00a0you a good overview of the doors opened by\u00a0an integration between Drupal and Elasticsearch, but also a solid head start on how to build such solutions yourself.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-search-and-beyond-with-elasticsearch", "length": "50:47", "likes": "7", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "In this presentation, we will look at real-life examples of innovative solutions that take advantage of Elasticsearch\u2019s capabili", "speaker_twitters": " @floretan", "speakers": {"florian-loretan": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Munich, Germany", "github": "floretan", "home": "http://happypixels.com/", "name": "Florian Loretan", "twitter": "floretan"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-search-and-beyond-with-elasticsearch", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ioxuWdmzrT0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Search and beyond with Elasticsearch"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ioxuWdmzrT0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Search and beyond with Elasticsearch", "tweet_video": "Search%20and%20beyond%20with%20Elasticsearch%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-dublin-2016/drupalcon-dublin-2016-search-and-beyond-with-elasticsearch%20presented%20%40drupalconeur%20by%20%40floretan", "videos": [{"code": "ioxuWdmzrT0", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "238"}
