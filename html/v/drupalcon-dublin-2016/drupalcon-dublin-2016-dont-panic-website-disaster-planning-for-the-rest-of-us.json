{"abstract": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016/sessions/dont-panic-website-disaster-planning-rest-us", "description": "There are plenty of resources that tell you\u00a0why\u00a0you need a disaster recovery plan (floods! hackers! snakes!), but it's hard to find good information on how to create one. Disaster preparedness and\u00a0recovery can be an intimidating and expensive-sounding prospect and most small site owners and developers simply throw their hands up and choose\u00a0the \"close your eyes and pray\" technique. This session will change that by outlining\u00a0a disaster prep plan that works for any site on any budget with any skill level.\n\nTypical\u00a0disaster recovery advice starts by telling you to make a list of all of the potential threats to your business but is\u00a0incredibly\u00a0vague about what you can actually do about those threats. This session takes a different approach. We start with the assumption that you can never predict what will take your site down, but if you are familiar with\u00a0the various moving parts involved\u00a0and know how to replace those parts when they fail, then you can\u00a0face any website emergency with confidence, aplomb and (mostly) dry pants.\n\nIn this session we will cover:\n\nWhat is a 'Disaster Recovery Plan' and how can you create one\nListing your site's\u00a0major\u00a0points of failure\nHow to prevent, detect and recover from failure at each of these points\nPreparation tips to make your disaster response go smoothly\nThis session should be useful for all Drupal site owners and builders.
