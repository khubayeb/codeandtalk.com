Sites which weren\u2019t upgraded immediately were all at risk. Many sites still haven\u2019t been upgraded and are ticking time-bombs.\u00a0\n\nThe Drupal security team releases updates every Wednesday, but even then, preparing for and installing patches can take up a significant amount of your team\u2019s development time.\u00a0\n\nLuckily, there\u2019s a solution. It\u2019s called automation and it's already available to use.\u00a0\n\nIn this session, we will share how we\u2019ve learned to tackle Drupal security:\u00a0\n\nHow the Drupal security patch release process works\u00a0\nHow to know when a new security patch is released\nWhich tools we use to automate this process\nWhy your Drupal hosting partner is a vital part of this process", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-drupal-security-there-is-a-mini-drupalgeddon", "length": "51:01", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "DrupaGeddon taught us all a very important lesson: security is not a state, it's a process, and when it hits, the damage is swif", "speaker_twitters": " @ManuelPistner @Schnitzel", "speakers": {"manuel-pistner": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Darmstadt, Germany", "github": "manuelbs", "home": "http://www.brightsolutions.de/", "name": "Manuel Pistner", "twitter": "ManuelPistner"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-drupal-security-there-is-a-mini-drupalgeddon", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ej8yiPHota4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Drupal Security: There is a Mini-DrupalGeddon"}]}, "michael-schmid": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Zurich, Switzerland", "github": "Schnitzel", "home": "http://schnitzel.io/", "name": "Michael Schmid", "twitter": "Schnitzel"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-drupal-security-there-is-a-mini-drupalgeddon", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ej8yiPHota4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Drupal Security: There is a Mini-DrupalGeddon"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ej8yiPHota4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Drupal Security: There is a Mini-DrupalGeddon", "tweet_video": "Drupal%20Security%3A%20There%20is%20a%20Mini-DrupalGeddon%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-dublin-2016/drupalcon-dublin-2016-drupal-security-there-is-a-mini-drupalgeddon%20presented%20%40drupalconeur%20by%20%40ManuelPistner%20by%20%40Schnitzel", "videos": [{"code": "ej8yiPHota4", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "193"}
