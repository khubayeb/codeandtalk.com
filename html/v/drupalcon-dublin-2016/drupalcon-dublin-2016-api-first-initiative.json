(We need to hear what you think is important and why.)\nhelp!\n<p>\nWe can provide mentoring: if you help out with patches, we'll provide reviews to help you land things in core!\n<p>\nAt this core conversation:\n<p>\nWe'll start with a succinct overview of what's going on, what has happened so far, and our long-term ambitions. Then we'll open the floor for discussion! When necessary, we'll explain subjects in more detail.\n<p>\nYou don't need to be an expert in anything, just rudimentary knowledge about web services is sufficient.\n<p>\nYou'll walk away knowing what's happening in the API-first initiative, and will hear about other attendees' concerns/thoughts/requirements/\n\n", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-api-first-initiative", "length": "59:08", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "We are working on making Drupal 8 truly API-first: API-first initative.
