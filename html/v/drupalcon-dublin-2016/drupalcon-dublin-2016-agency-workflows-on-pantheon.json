That's\u00a0more than all digital advertising -\u00a0$110B.\n\nWho is doing the\u00a0lion's share of the\u00a0work? The Digital Agencies.\u00a0There are more than 100,000 digital agencies out there and they employ over 1 million\u00a0professionals.\n\nThe success of the agencies is the web's success.\n\nBut here is something that we've learned at Pantheon: For those agencies using Drupal - the success of the agencies is literally Drupal's success. If we want to continue to\u00a0drive adoption of Drupal, we need to help agencies do their jobs well. When we do that, everyone benefits. Pantheon gives away powerful features and incredible content to help anyone who builds websites for clients.\n\nIn this session, we will take a close\u00a0look at the numbers behind the web development industry and examine what we learned through 5 years as a website management platform for developers. We will also do a deep dive into the product to see all of the free features and discuss how they can help agencies grow.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-agency-workflows-on-pantheon", "length": "36:16", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "Websites are the most important digital marketing investment companies make.
