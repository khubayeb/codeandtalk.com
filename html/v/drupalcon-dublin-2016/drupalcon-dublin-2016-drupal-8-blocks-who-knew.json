If you wanted to manage any kind of complicated layout you probably used Panels or the Context module.\n\nLuckily for Drupal 8 the Block system has been vastly improved by a few key features:\n\nBlocks are exportable\nBlocks can be placed multiple times\nFieldable Blocks are in core\nBlocks use Condition plugins\nThis session will look at how we can use these and other changes to the Block system in Drupal 8 as powerful site building tools. We will look at some smaller contrib modules in Drupal 8, like\u00a0Block Visibility Groups, that will make the Block system even better. This session will focus on simpler solutions that don't abandon the Block administration page altogether but make it much better.\n\nWe will also look at changes to the Block system that will be added to Drupal 8.2 and changes that are being planned for the near future.\n\nAudience:\n\nThis session is anyone is interested in building sites in Drupal 8.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-drupal-8-blocks-who-knew", "length": "50:45", "likes": "4", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "In Drupal 7, for all but the most simple sites it seemed like no one used the core Block system.
