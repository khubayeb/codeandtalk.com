They transitioned over a period of several months from a more traditional department structure working on \u2018projects\u2019 to a fixed team structure working for clients and building and maintaining products.\n\nThis talk is interesting for SCRUM masters and project managers looking for tips on common challenges such as:\n\norganizing the roles of team members, for example product owners and other non-developers such as designers\nmanaging agile sprints for different customers, with one team.\u00a0\ntime and billable rate reporting\nfacilitating a distributed team across timezones\nFor business owners this talk is interesting because it touches upon:\n\nreal world business metrics such as billable rates and turnover per full-time employee\na vision how this team structure supports a culture of shared responsibility, collaboration and professional excellence\na vision how this team structure supports a path for sustainable agency growth, with reduced risk\u00a0\nThe last 10 minutes are reserved for discussion on an\u00a0aspect\u00a0that proves to be especially challenging:\n\nintegrating sales into the teams instead, of more traditionally, account managers or directors", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-transitioning-to-fixed-teams", "length": "57:10", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "In this session a SCRUM master, Evelien Schut, and a business owner, Mieszko Czyzyk, share the lessons learned from transitionin", "speaker_twitters": " @mieszkoGG @evelienschut", "speakers": {"evelien-schut": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "The Netherlands", "name": "Evelien Schut", "twitter": "evelienschut"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-transitioning-to-fixed-teams", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f2f8ctZdomg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Transitioning to fixed teams"}]}, "mieszko-czyzyk": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "github": "miesz-ko", "home": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/mieszkoczyzyk", "name": "Mieszko Czyzyk", "twitter": "mieszkoGG"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-transitioning-to-fixed-teams", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f2f8ctZdomg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Transitioning to fixed teams"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f2f8ctZdomg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Transitioning to fixed teams", "tweet_video": "Transitioning%20to%20fixed%20teams%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-dublin-2016/drupalcon-dublin-2016-transitioning-to-fixed-teams%20presented%20%40drupalconeur%20by%20%40mieszkoGG%20by%20%40evelienschut", "videos": [{"code": "f2f8ctZdomg", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "123"}
