Some of the topics we will cover are:\n\nAlignment: collaborating on one shared goal.\nCommunication: communicating the product vision to external developers (PO); bringing multiple parties together in line with one sprint goal (SM); communicating product developments and value back to the business (PO).\nProduct delivery: managing an in-life product, iterative releases and a large user base.\nOrganisational shift: championing the value of agile to the wider Investors in People business and promoting culture shift.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-managing-an-agile-team-of-internal-and-external-partners", "length": "51:04", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "Managing an agile team is one thing when you're all part of the same organisation, so how do you manage a hyper-creative, cross-", "speaker_twitters": " @akoutlas", "speakers": {"tassos-koutlas": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Brighton, UK", "github": "tassoskoutlas", "home": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/koutlas", "name": "Tassos Koutlas", "twitter": "akoutlas"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-managing-an-agile-team-of-internal-and-external-partners", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LZWWGKqzG6w/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Managing an agile team of internal and external partners"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LZWWGKqzG6w/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Managing an agile team of internal and external partners", "tweet_video": "Managing%20an%20agile%20team%20of%20internal%20and%20external%20partners%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-dublin-2016/drupalcon-dublin-2016-managing-an-agile-team-of-internal-and-external-partners%20presented%20%40drupalconeur%20by%20%40akoutlas", "videos": [{"code": "LZWWGKqzG6w", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "110"}
