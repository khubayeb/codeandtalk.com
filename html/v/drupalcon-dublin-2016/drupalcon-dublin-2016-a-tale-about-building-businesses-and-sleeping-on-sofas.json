{"abstract": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016/sessions/tale-about-building-businesses-and-sleeping-sofas", "description": "Success stories are often not created in fancy board rooms and successful web agencies are often not built by talented web developers.\n\nIn 2007, I took a leap of faith and quit my financial advisory job to start a web startup. The platform offered a social collaboration tool to the world - built on Drupal 5 of course. This was the birth of the Amazee Group, which brings Drupal websites to the world from three locations and over 40 bright minds. Since 2007, I\u2019ve been living my dream. A dream full of ups and downs and with full awareness that we only live once.\n\nIn this session I want to share with you my personal startup and business story - this may or may not include tales about:\n\nBuilding five companies in nine years on three continents\n\nHaving two children during times of rapid company growth\n\nLearning about humans by assessing over 150 Amazee applicants\n\nDiscovering the South African Drupal community after moving from Switzerland\n\nBeing a woman in tech and a female entrepreneur\n\nSleeping on office sofas and not sleeping in airplanes\n\nThis is not your usual business talk. This session is for anyone wanting to hear a personal story about a founder of a Drupal agency and looking for some inspiration to take a life-changing leap.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-a-tale-about-building-businesses-and-sleeping-on-sofas", "length": "49:55", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "Success stories are often not created in fancy board rooms and successful web agencies are often not built by talented web devel", "speaker_twitters": " @DaniaGerhardt", "speakers": {"dania-gerhardt": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "South Africa", "home": "https://www.amazeelabs.com/en", "name": "Dania Gerhardt", "twitter": "DaniaGerhardt"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-a-tale-about-building-businesses-and-sleeping-on-sofas", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EvPSroZrfWM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "A tale about building businesses and sleeping on sofas"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EvPSroZrfWM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "A tale about building businesses and sleeping on sofas", "tweet_video": "A%20tale%20about%20building%20businesses%20and%20sleeping%20on%20sofas%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-dublin-2016/drupalcon-dublin-2016-a-tale-about-building-businesses-and-sleeping-on-sofas%20presented%20%40drupalconeur%20by%20%40DaniaGerhardt", "videos": [{"code": "EvPSroZrfWM", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "89"}
