The community has a problem with documentation because there is not a public and community repository in their language were they can find documentation in their language in an 'official' way. Also, when people have the courage to ask something in a language other than English, almost immediate they are repealed for it. Again, that doesn't help in the process of creating community in emerging markets for Drupal.\n\n\"Being a\u00a0\"knowmad\"\u00a0and share experiences with Drupal Communities\"\u00a0\n\nNowadays connection between people is everything if you don't believe that check the\u00a0LinkedIn deal with Microsoft. Our Drupal Community is global and we have a lot of travelers, but for those guys, there is not an easy way to try to be in contact with local communities in an effective way.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-community-keynote-lessons-learnt-from-my-tour", "length": "01:01:46", "likes": "16", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "After complete my tour Around the Drupal world in 120+ days, I want to share what I learn from all communities I visited, below ", "speaker_twitters": " @enzolutions", "speakers": {"eduardo-enzo-garcia": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Costa Rica", "github": "enzolutions", "home": "http://www.anexusit.com/", "name": "enzo -Eduardo Garcia", "twitter": "enzolutions"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-community-keynote-lessons-learnt-from-my-tour", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/clxizOD0IbY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Community Keynote: Lessons Learnt From My Tour"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-drupal-console-an-overview-of-the-new-drupal-cli", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zBqdae_sves/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Drupal Console: An Overview of the New Drupal CLI"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-learn-the-new-things-in-drupal-8-via-debugging", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b6AYtvrznmM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Learn the new things in Drupal 8 via debugging"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalSouth 2016", "nickname": "drupalsouth-2016", "twitter": "drupalsouth", "url": "https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/"}, "filename": "session-learn-the-new-things-in-drupal-8-via-debugging-by-eduardo-enzo-garcia", "recorded": "2016-10-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ehq9UZO5lS4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Learn the new things in Drupal 8 via Debugging"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/clxizOD0IbY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Community Keynote: Lessons Learnt From My Tour", "tweet_video": "Community%20Keynote%3A%20Lessons%20Learnt%20From%20My%20Tour%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-dublin-2016/drupalcon-dublin-2016-community-keynote-lessons-learnt-from-my-tour%20presented%20%40drupalconeur%20by%20%40enzolutions", "videos": [{"code": "clxizOD0IbY", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "416"}
