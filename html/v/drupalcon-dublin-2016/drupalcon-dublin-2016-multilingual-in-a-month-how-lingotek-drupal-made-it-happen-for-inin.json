{"abstract": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016/sessions/Multilingual-in-a-Month-How-Lingotek-Drupal-Made-it-happen-for-ININ", "description": "When the Interactive Intelligence (ININ) digital marketing team decided they wanted to make their soon-to-be-released Drupal website multilingual, they were under a time crunch and faced some daunting challenges. The site was planned to go live in December, and site construction started in November. ININ needed a multilingual solution that would integrate deeply with Drupal and enable an automated workflow for translation of their content.\n\nThis business showcase session will focus on the ININ project - initial goals, solution implemented, challenges overcome and lessons learned. During this 30-minute session, we will cover:\n\nThe initial challenges that this project faced\n\nThe multilingual Drupal solution that was implemented\n\nLessons learned & best practices for making your Drupal site multilingual\n\nThe value of an integrated, cloud-based translation solution\n\nAs this session will be more business focused, attendees do not need to have any specific Drupal knowledge in order to benefit from the presentation. Through this presentation, attendees will gain first-hand insight into the challenges facing Drupal sites that are moving towards multilingual capabilities and solutions to those common issues. The session will cover tips and tricks for those with multilingual projects, which will help those wishing to expand their brand and website internationally.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-multilingual-in-a-month-how-lingotek-drupal-made-it-happen-for-inin", "length": "32:09", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "When the Interactive Intelligence (ININ) digital marketing team decided they wanted to make their soon-to-be-released Drupal web", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {"clark-fuller": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"name": "Clark Fuller"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-multilingual-in-a-month-how-lingotek-drupal-made-it-happen-for-inin", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QFsP8JT98_s/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Multilingual in a Month!
