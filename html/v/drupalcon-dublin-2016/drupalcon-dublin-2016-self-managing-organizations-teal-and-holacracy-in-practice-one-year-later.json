At the end of the talk we discussed the pro`s and con`s of evolving our\u00a0own organizational model or take something\u00a0\"of the shelf\", namely\u00a0Holacracy.\n\nWe received a lot of\u00a0great feedback and quite some buzz around that talk.\n\nNow, nearly a year later a lot of things happened. Did go with Holacracy, we officially removed the management positions, we had great successes and great frustrations. We want to be open and\u00a0share a honest picture of our experience the past year.\n\nWe think that these insights will proof very helpful for agencies facing the \"Going for Growth\" topic.\n\nTo reach a broder audience the talk will\u00a0recap what happened before Drupalcon Barcelona, and give a short introduction into the topic of self managing organizations before the deepdive into our experience of the past year.\n\nSo\u00a0a \"beginner\" will get at least a first eye-opening experience and some entertainment, an \"intermediate\" (already read about the topic, maybe attended\u00a0the talk a year ago) gets encouraged to go this way while an \"expert\" (working on the same topic) gets valuable insight in real world problems and solutions.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-self-managing-organizations-teal-and-holacracy-in-practice-one-year-later", "length": "01:03:46", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "At Drupalcon Barcelona Lukas Smith an I, Tonio Zemp, presented the way of the company Liip AG (150 people all in Switzerland) in", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {"tonio-zemp": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"name": "Tonio Zemp"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-self-managing-organizations-teal-and-holacracy-in-practice-one-year-later", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_gWnDQbmUY8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Self managing organizations, Teal and Holacracy in practice - one year later"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_gWnDQbmUY8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Self managing organizations, Teal and Holacracy in practice - one year later", "tweet_video": "Self%20managing%20organizations%2C%20Teal%20and%20Holacracy%20in%20practice%20-%20one%20year%20later%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-dublin-2016/drupalcon-dublin-2016-self-managing-organizations-teal-and-holacracy-in-practice-one-year-later%20presented%20%40drupalconeur", "videos": [{"code": "_gWnDQbmUY8", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "156"}
