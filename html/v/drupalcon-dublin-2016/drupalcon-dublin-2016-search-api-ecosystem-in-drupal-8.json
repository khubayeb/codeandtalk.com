We will talk about Search API, Apache Solr, Facet API and other related modules.\n\nOver the course of the last years I've been heavily involved in how Search in Drupal 8 should take form and what needed to change to use the new API's and best practices\u00a0in the revised Search API module. In this presentation I hope to give you some guidance what is still pending and what already was done. I will also try to explain what effort it takes to push and move such projects.\n\nIt'll be useful for attendees to know / have used the Search API or Apachesolr modules in drupal 7, no prior knowledge of the modules in Drupal 8 is needed.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-search-api-ecosystem-in-drupal-8", "length": "44:18", "likes": "2", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "In this session I'll give you an overview what changed so far in Drupal 8 in regards to the Search eco-system.
