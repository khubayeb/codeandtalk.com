{"description": "Don't miss it! 8:00 on Tuesday! Get a good seat for Dries' keynote!\n\nCoder and Themer are back! The Irish say there\u2019s a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, and Drupal\u2019s dynamic duo are determined to find it. But trapping a leprechaun will take more than just good kung fu and code indents!\n\nCome and help our intrepid heroes on their Irish adventure as they overcome obstacles, form new alliances, and travel to the very edge of scope (but not beyond!). Maybe you\u2019ll even get a piece of that Leprechaun gold yourself!\n\n\"If you only get up early once during DrupalCon, this is the morning to do it. And hey, at least you'll get better seats for my keynote right after.\" - Dries\nA DrupalCon institution, the opening \"Prenote\" has been getting people excited about DrupalCon since 2010. An infotainment extravaganza featuring Drupal community stars and friends; music and sing-a-longs; bad jokes; technical tutorials on Git, yodelling, use of the alphabet, and even proper beer pouring technique, what\u2019s not to like? Especially eye-opening if you've never been to DrupalCon or never gotten up early enough to see one of these yet.\n\n\u201cWhy do I always have to dress up as some kind of crustacean?!?\u201d - Crell\nViewer discretion is advised.
