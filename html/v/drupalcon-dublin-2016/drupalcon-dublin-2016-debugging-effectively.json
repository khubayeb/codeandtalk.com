{"abstract": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016/sessions/debugging-effectively", "description": "Software bugs are inevitable; some are especially difficult to track down, causing you to waste countless hours before throwing your hands up in defeat. It doesn't have to be this way! The mental fatigue and wasted time can be avoided by using strategies like identifying the most-appropriate tool, taking a logical & objective approach, challenging assumptions, listening to variables, isolating the code path, and reinforcing code with automated tests. Attendees will learn how to combine these techniques with the right mindset and attitude in order to debug their code quickly and effectively.\n\nSlides:\u00a0http://www.slideshare.net/colinodell/debugging-effectively-drupalcon-europe-2016", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-debugging-effectively", "length": "47:09", "likes": "4", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "Software bugs are inevitable; some are especially difficult to track down, causing you to waste countless hours before throwing ", "speaker_twitters": " @colinodell", "speakers": {"colin-odell": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "MD, USA", "github": "colinodell", "home": "https://www.colinodell.com/", "name": "Colin O'Dell", "twitter": "colinodell"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-debugging-effectively", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yo8B03ZLCs4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Debugging Effectively"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yo8B03ZLCs4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Debugging Effectively", "tweet_video": "Debugging%20Effectively%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-dublin-2016/drupalcon-dublin-2016-debugging-effectively%20presented%20%40drupalconeur%20by%20%40colinodell", "videos": [{"code": "yo8B03ZLCs4", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "225"}
