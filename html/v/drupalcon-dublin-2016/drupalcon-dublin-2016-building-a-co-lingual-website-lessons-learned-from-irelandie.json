A decision was taken to present both languages side by side wherever possible for the 1916 commemorations - including on the website.\u00a0This session will focus on the unusual co-lingual [2 languages side-by-side]\u00a0approach, and how Drupal made it possible. Rather than each language being handled independently and viewed one language at a time, we had to accomodate both languages side by side\u00a0on both the front and back end.\n\nWhat level of knowledge should attendees have before walking into your session\n\nAttendees should have some experience in building at least basic Drupal websites. The session will be especially useful to users building multilingual sites or\u00a0complex websites for cultural events.\n\nWhat will your session accomplish and what will attendees walk away having learned\n\nWhen and\u00a0why a co-lingual website is appropriate\nChallenges that this approach presents\nIllustrate how to handle a co-lingual presentation of content at front and back-end, using\u00a0views\u00a0as a key tool.\nOutline an approach to site-building that puts a high value on editorial experience, with judicious use of the\u00a0paragraphs\u00a0module.\nWhat we wish we'd done differently!\nWe'll also outline how these approaches\u00a0have evolved in our use of Drupal 8.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-building-a-co-lingual-website-lessons-learned-from-irelandie", "length": "58:18", "likes": "2", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "2016 marks the centenary of the 1916 rising in Dublin, a pivotal year in Irish history, and is marked with a series of high-prof", "speaker_twitters": " @alanjosephburke", "speakers": {"alan-burke": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Galway, Ireland", "home": "http://cycletraffic.com/", "name": "Alan Burke", "twitter": "alanjosephburke"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-building-a-co-lingual-website-lessons-learned-from-irelandie", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V5yTGkATs3k/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Building a co-lingual website - lessons learned from ireland.ie"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-choosing-drupal-insights-from-an-irish-multinational", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/woMk6Jz0OLI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Choosing Drupal - Insights from an Irish multinational"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V5yTGkATs3k/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Building a co-lingual website - lessons learned from ireland.ie", "tweet_video": "Building%20a%20co-lingual%20website%20-%20lessons%20learned%20from%20ireland.ie%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-dublin-2016/drupalcon-dublin-2016-building-a-co-lingual-website-lessons-learned-from-irelandie%20presented%20%40drupalconeur%20by%20%40alanjosephburke", "videos": [{"code": "V5yTGkATs3k", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "75"}
