{"abstract": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016/sessions/launching-online-stores-commerce-2x-drupal-8", "description": "In this session we present the history, architecture, and features of Drupal Commerce 2.x on Drupal 8. We will highlight specifically the things we've benefited from as we've helped launch stores with it by DrupalCon Dublin.\n\nCommerce 2.x development began with a code sprint in\u00a0July 2014. We first released a handful of standalone PHP libraries (e.g. for currency formatting and addressing)\u00a0and then created modules that make use of them, such as the new\u00a0Address module. Finally, we rebuilt Drupal Commerce itself from the ground up, taking full advantage of Drupal 8's new features\u00a0-- and even improving them in turn!\n\nCome learn how we've engineered\u00a0Commerce 2.x to make it simpler to solve some of the hardest parts of eCommerce.\u00a0You do not need prior experience with Drupal Commerce to attend, but some familiarity with Drupal 8 and common challenges in\u00a0eCommerce will help you get the most out of the material.\n\nWe will include both instruction and demonstration of topics including:\n\nInstalling Drupal Commerce and its dependencies\nCreating and configuring one or multiple stores\nFull support for currency and address formatting\nAdding product pages and their variants\nCustomizing Add to Cart forms and Line Items\nConfiguring the redesigned Checkout form\nManaging Payment methods and their new UI\nManaging\u00a0Orders and their workflows\nWe'll close with an overview of the roadmap and status of the contributed module ecosystem. We'll make sure everyone knows how to start\u00a0contributing to Commerce 2.x - there's always more to do! ; )", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-launching-online-stores-with-commerce-2x-on-drupal-8", "length": "01:02:30", "likes": "16", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "In this session we present the history, architecture, and features of Drupal Commerce 2.x on Drupal 8.
