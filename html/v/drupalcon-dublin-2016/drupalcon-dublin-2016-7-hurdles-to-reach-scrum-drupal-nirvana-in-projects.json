It represents the final goal of Buddhism.\n\n-------\n\nFor the last couple of years, i\u2019ve been working as a Scrum Master and a Scrum Product Owner within Drupal Agencies.\nThe world is taken over by this \u201cthing\u201d called Agile and Scrum is one of the forms in which it surfaces.\n\nAs they say: Scrum is easy to understand but hard to master.\nSpecifically in Drupal Agencies there are some quirks and pitfalls when a team is trying to use scrum.\nI like to take you on a bumpy ride through the challenges I\u2019ve encountered trying to master Scrum in\u00a0digital agencies\u00a0using Drupal, although these hurdles are not restricted to Drupal. In having conversations with a lot of my peers I found out that there are a lot of great ways to make Scrum work, and I would like to share my insights on how to take the hurdles to reach Scrum nirvana, or at least be Kaizen :)\nI think it will be recognisable for all you Agilistas out there.\n\nThe seven hurdles:\n\n1. Scrum and Customers\u00a0\n\u201cSure we want this Agile thing! So where\u2019s our functional design?!\u201d\n\n2. Scrum and Drupal development\u00a0\nExperts versus generalists, junior versus senior\n\n3. Scrum and Human Resources\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a scrummaster, productowner and projectmanager in one\u00a0who can lead the team!\u201d\n\n4. Scrum and Support\u00a0\n\u201cCritical Security updates in the middle of a sprint.. again..\u201d\n\n5. Scrum and Technical dept \u00a0\n\u201cNew features are more important to the client then cleaning up your code\u201d\n\n6. Scrum and Projectbudgets \n\u201cEvery team works at only one project at a time right?\u201d\n\n7. Scrum and Waterscrum aka ScrumBut\n\u201cWe use Scrum in our own way, and call it Waterscrum!\u201d\n\u201cWe use Jira and post-its, so yes we are scrumming! A retro-what?\u201d\u00a0\n\nThis talk is interesting for anyone who has a basic knowledge of Scrum and Agile.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-7-hurdles-to-reach-scrum-drupal-nirvana-in-projects", "length": "01:00:50", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "nirvana n\u026a\u0259\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0n\u0259/ noun (in Buddhism) a transcendent state in which there is neither suffering, desire, nor sense of self, and t", "speaker_twitters": " @NancyvB", "speakers": {"nancy-beers": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "The Netherlands", "home": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancybeers", "name": "Nancy Beers", "twitter": "NancyvB"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-7-hurdles-to-reach-scrum-drupal-nirvana-in-projects", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KNW9NiHLQ6U/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "7 hurdles to reach Scrum Drupal Nirvana in projects."}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KNW9NiHLQ6U/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "7 hurdles to reach Scrum Drupal Nirvana in projects.", "tweet_video": "7%20hurdles%20to%20reach%20Scrum%20Drupal%20Nirvana%20in%20projects.%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-dublin-2016/drupalcon-dublin-2016-7-hurdles-to-reach-scrum-drupal-nirvana-in-projects%20presented%20%40drupalconeur%20by%20%40NancyvB", "videos": [{"code": "KNW9NiHLQ6U", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "123"}
