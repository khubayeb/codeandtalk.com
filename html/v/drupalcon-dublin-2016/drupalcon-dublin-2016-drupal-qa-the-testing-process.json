{"abstract": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016/sessions/drupal-qa-testing-process-drupal-limitations-and-satisfying-client-expecations", "description": "PRESENTATION\u00a0DETAILED OVERVIEW\n\nThis DevOps session will be about specific challenges that were encountered in testing Drupal and how those challenges were overcome to satisfy client requirements and expectations.\u00a0 These challenges lead me to believe that others involved at\u00a0the beginning of their Drupal development experience, both Developers and Testers, will probably\u00a0encounter similar challenges. \u00a0\n\nThe DevOps session I would like to present is for those starting to develop and test in Drupal about what kind of challenges they may face and suggest paths to their solutions.\u00a0 Both beginners and probably those with more Drupal experience will be interested to know and curious to see the varieties of bugs and issues encountered in Drupal development and how the issues were settled beyond simple bug fixes.\u00a0 These bugs and issues in question were not merely Developer errors, but the actual results of what the Drupal software produces.\u00a0 The session will not focus on Drupal problems, but their solutions. \u00a0\n\nAlso, we will discuss the concepts of verification and validation.\u00a0 In other words, \u201cAre we delivering the right system?\u201d, and \u201cIs the system right?\u201d, and what is the role of Quality Assurance in answering these questions. \u00a0\n\nHaving given several presentations at national academic conferences, I now turn from the academic to the technical field to try to explore questions regarding software testing.\u00a0 These questions include, for example, \u201cWhat is a bug?\u201d, \u201cWhat is the role of QA in satisfying requirements beyond bug hunting?\u201d, and \u201cWhat do we do to satisfy client expectations when requirements surpass Drupal\u2019s capabilities?\u201d\u00a0 The aim of these questions is to foster debate and conversation about promoting Drupal not only as a software development tool\u00a0but also as a means of improved Quality Assurance, that bugs can be found and fixed quickly and that the system clients expect will be delivered.\n\n\n\nWHAT WILL THE SESSION ACCOMPLISH:\n\nThe aim of the session will be to give to beginning Drupal Developers and QA the mindset to keep an eye on quality throughout the development and testing processes. \u00a0\n\nThe importance of communication with the client is of paramount importance in resolving issues that Drupal alone cannot. \u00a0 In these instances, solutions will involve trying to reach common ground with the client to produce satisfactory results. \u00a0 Both the Drupal Development team and client must know, for the former, what exactly the client wants, and for the latter, what Drupal can produce. \u00a0\n\n\n\nWHAT WILL THE ATTENDEES WALK AWAY HAVING LEARNED:\n\nThe attendees will have learned about system verification and validation, different varieties of software issues found in Drupal projects, and ways to circumvent Drupal deficiencies to meet our client\u2019s expectations. \u00a0\n\nThe attendees will know the importance of observation: both Developers and QA must observe carefully what is produced and be able to answer 2 questions: 1) does the application function correctly, and 2) is this functionality what the client wants?\n\nCommunication \u2013 attendees will also walk away having learned the importance of communication on a number of levels throughout the project, from high-level documentation from upper management to specifications for Development and QA.\u00a0 Testing results must also be communicated back up the chain, to Development and\u00a0Management and then to the Client for final validation.\u00a0 Problems will result throughout the Development process, but issues beyond simple bug fixes must be related to the client to reach common ground to satisfy requirements.", "event":
