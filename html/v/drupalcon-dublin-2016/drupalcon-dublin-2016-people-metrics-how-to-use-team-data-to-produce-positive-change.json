{"abstract": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016/sessions/people-metrics", "description": "Summary\n\nUsually when people think of metrics, the first things that come to mind are CPU, memory, or application response times. But what about metrics for human beings? After all, the health of a team will directly influence the health of a service or product!\n\nI will go over the types of metrics that I have relied on over the past couple years at Acquia as a manager of an Ops team and how they have driven behavioral, cultural, and organizational change. I will then show:\n\nhow to generate similar metrics yourself;\nhow to interpret them;\nhow to present them to peers and management\u00a0as a vehicle of producing change\u00a0\nIntended Audience\n\nEngineers/Managers looking to improve their products and quality-of-life for their teams.\n\nKnowledge Required\n\nLittle tech knowledge necessary. Knowledge about time-series services like Graphite is a plus!\n\nGoal of Presentation\n\nTo generate\u00a0an awareness around the types of metrics that can be captured for a team and how they can be used towards creating a happier and\u00a0more successful business.\u00a0\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\nThe Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win\nScrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time\nThe Practice of Cloud System Administration: Designing and Operating Large Distributed Systems, Volume 2", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-people-metrics-how-to-use-team-data-to-produce-positive-change", "length": "56:41", "likes": "3", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "short_description": "Summary Usually when people think of metrics, the first things that come to mind are CPU, memory, or application response times.", "speaker_twitters": " @aastaneh", "speakers": {"amin-astaneh": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "USA", "github": "aastaneh", "home": "http://aminastaneh.net/", "name": "Amin Astaneh", "twitter": "aastaneh"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-people-metrics-how-to-use-team-data-to-produce-positive-change", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7XcyS334qQ0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "People Metrics: How to Use Team Data to Produce Positive Change"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7XcyS334qQ0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "People Metrics: How to Use Team Data to Produce Positive Change", "tweet_video": "People%20Metrics%3A%20How%20to%20Use%20Team%20Data%20to%20Produce%20Positive%20Change%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-dublin-2016/drupalcon-dublin-2016-people-metrics-how-to-use-team-data-to-produce-positive-change%20presented%20%40drupalconeur%20by%20%40aastaneh", "videos": [{"code": "7XcyS334qQ0", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "131"}
