{"description": "JavaScript that writes JavaScript: Christoph will give an intro to jscodeshift and the underlying tools like recast and ast-types that help rewrite and modernize a lot of Facebook\u2019s JavaScript code day-to-day. We\u2019ll explore why these tools become increasingly important and how they change how we think about open source and breaking API changes at Facebook. At the end of the talk everyone will be able to run their own code transformations across all of their projects safely and efficiently.\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte", "event": {"name": "JSConf Europe 2015", "nickname": "jsconf-eu-2015", "twitter": "jsconfeu", "url": "http://2015.jsconf.eu/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "christoph-pojer-evolving-complex-systems-incrementally-jsconf-eu-2015", "length": "33:27", "likes": "157", "recorded": "2015-09-25", "short_description": "JavaScript that writes JavaScript: Christoph will give an intro to jscodeshift and the underlying tools like recast and ast-type", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d0pOgY8__JM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Christoph Pojer: Evolving Complex Systems Incrementally | JSConf EU 2015", "tweet_video": "Christoph%20Pojer%3A%20Evolving%20Complex%20Systems%20Incrementally%20%7C%20JSConf%20EU%202015%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/jsconf-eu-2015/christoph-pojer-evolving-complex-systems-incrementally-jsconf-eu-2015%20presented%20%40jsconfeu", "videos": [{"code": "d0pOgY8__JM", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "9212"}
