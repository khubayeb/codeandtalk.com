{"description": "Do you know how JavaScript engines work and why they are so blazingly fast?\n\nLearn about the fundamentals like abstract syntax tree, opcodes, and just-in-time compilation. JavaScript code can be almost as fast as native C++ code. How do engines accomplish this? Lets look into optimization techniques including hidden classes, ahead-of-time compilation, and single instruction multiple data computations, which, if applied correctly, will give your code a turbo boost.\n\nUnderstand the inner workings of JavaScript engines and learn by examples how to write faster code.\n\n*SpiderMonkey, SquirrelFish (Nitro), Nashorn, and V8 are JavaScript engines for Firefox, Safari, JVM, and Chrome.\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte", "event": {"name": "JSConf Europe 2015", "nickname": "jsconf-eu-2015", "twitter": "jsconfeu", "url": "http://2015.jsconf.eu/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "franziska-hinkelmann-a-trip-to-the-zoo-spidermonkey-squirrelfish-nashorn-v8-jsconf-eu-2015", "length": "26:54", "likes": "35", "recorded": "2015-09-25", "short_description": "Do you know how JavaScript engines work and why they are so blazingly fast?
