For data that changes continuously in time (animations, gesture controlled UI, responsive layout, etc), these are not the best tools. By treating continuously changing layout data in a functional way, and updating discrete changes to a model\u2019s data in an MV* way, we can split the data-binding problem into two cleanly separated problems. In so doing we make all our tools better at what they do best.\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte", "event": {"name": "JSConf Europe 2015", "nickname": "jsconf-eu-2015", "twitter": "jsconfeu", "url": "http://2015.jsconf.eu/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "david-valdman-functional-layout-updating-the-dom-at-60fps-jsconf-eu-2015", "length": "24:57", "likes": "74", "recorded": "2015-09-25", "short_description": "We present a functional take on front-end data-binding.
