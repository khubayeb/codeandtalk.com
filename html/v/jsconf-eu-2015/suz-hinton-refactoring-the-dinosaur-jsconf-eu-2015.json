By leveraging the strengths of NodeJS, decade-old stagnant tools and libraries can be greatly improved when rewritten in JavaScript. Keeping this in mind, how do you even go about refactoring a fossilized piece of software while still preserving your sanity?\n\nTo answer this question, we\u2019ll dig into an example of how you can create a modern, JavaScript-powered interface for users to program your device.
