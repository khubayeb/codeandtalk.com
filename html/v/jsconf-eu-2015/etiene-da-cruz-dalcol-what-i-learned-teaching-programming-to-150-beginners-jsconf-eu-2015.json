That was an amazing experience that taught me incredible things and motivated me to open source all the steps. Some of the topics I\u2019ll cover on this talk are:\n\n- Why Javascript is an appropriate introductory language to programming, versus popular teaching choices such as Python\n\n- What is feasible in a short length workshop\n\n- How programming workshops empower and inspire learners\n\n- How this experience contributed to my own learning, as well as personal and professional growth\n\n- The materials to reproduce this workshop\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte", "event": {"name": "JSConf Europe 2015", "nickname": "jsconf-eu-2015", "twitter": "jsconfeu", "url": "http://2015.jsconf.eu/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "etiene-da-cruz-dalcol-what-i-learned-teaching-programming-to-150-beginners-jsconf-eu-2015", "length": "18:45", "likes": "39", "recorded": "2015-09-25", "short_description": "A few months ago I was invited to give a workshop at Women\u2019s International Leadership Conference on Introduction to Programming.", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YuezRMnwyeI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Etiene da Cruz Dalcol: What I learned teaching programming to 150 beginners | JSConf EU 2015", "tweet_video": "Etiene%20da%20Cruz%20Dalcol%3A%20What%20I%20learned%20teaching%20programming%20to%20150%20beginners%20%7C%20JSConf%20EU%202015%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/jsconf-eu-2015/etiene-da-cruz-dalcol-what-i-learned-teaching-programming-to-150-beginners-jsconf-eu-2015%20presented%20%40jsconfeu", "videos": [{"code": "YuezRMnwyeI", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "1984"}
