{"description": "Slides and recording of \"Access Without Empowerment\" a keynote address I gave in Cambridge, Massachusetts at LibrePlanet 2015 hosted by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nTALK SUMMARY: The free software movement has twin goals: promoting access to software through users' freedom to share, and empowering users by giving them control over their technology. For all our movement's success, we have been much more successful at the former. I will use data from free software and from several related movements to explain why promoting empowerment is systematically more difficult than promoting access and I will explore how our movement might address the second challenge in the future.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The views and opinions expressed herein are those of the speaker and do not necessarily reflect those of the Free Software Foundation.", "event": {"name": "LibrePlanet 2015", "nickname": "libreplanet-2015", "twitter": "", "url": "https://libreplanet.org/2015/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "access-without-empowerment-benjamin-mako-hill-libreplanet-2015", "length": "45:59", "likes": "7", "recorded": "2015-03-21", "short_description": "Slides and recording of Access Without Empowerment a keynote address I gave in Cambridge, Massachusetts at LibrePlanet 2015 host", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XUd4J4t8StE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Access Without Empowerment - Benjamin Mako Hill - LibrePlanet 2015", "tweet_video": "Access%20Without%20Empowerment%20-%20Benjamin%20Mako%20Hill%20-%20LibrePlanet%202015%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/libreplanet-2015/access-without-empowerment-benjamin-mako-hill-libreplanet-2015", "videos": [{"code": "XUd4J4t8StE", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "303"}
