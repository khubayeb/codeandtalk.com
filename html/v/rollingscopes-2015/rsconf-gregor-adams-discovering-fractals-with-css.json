He works as a front-end developer and architect at SinnerSchrader. Gregor is very active on codepen where he shows a lot of abstract CSS experiments. While he has no special focus when is comes to CSS his most impressive works are related to 3d shapes or fractals. Gregor speaks at conferences and meetups with a strong urge to teach or help other developers. He pushes his own limits every day, staying up to date with the latest specs, finding fixes for browser quirks or trying to do the impossible.", "event": {"name": "Rolling Scopes 2015", "nickname": "rollingscopes-2015", "twitter": "rollingscopes", "url": "https://2015.conf.rollingscopes.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-31", "filename": "rsconf-gregor-adams-discovering-fractals-with-css", "length": "34:28", "likes": "9", "recorded": "2015-02-01", "short_description": "Rolling Scopes Conference.
