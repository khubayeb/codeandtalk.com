Right now, functional programming seems to be one of the dos, while Javascript remains one of the musts. In particular, Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) seems to be a perfect fit for tackling the problems related to keeping a complex and highly asynchronous application codebase nice and readable. Juha is the author of Bacon.js - the FRP library for Javascript. He uses it at work every day to create modern web apps for his clients.", "event": {"name": "Rolling Scopes 2015", "nickname": "rollingscopes-2015", "twitter": "rollingscopes", "url": "https://2015.conf.rollingscopes.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-31", "filename": "rsconf-juha-paananen-frp-with-baconjs", "length": "45:34", "likes": "8", "recorded": "2015-02-01", "short_description": "Rolling Scopes Conference.
