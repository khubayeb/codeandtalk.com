{"description": "Life on Earth has existed for at least 3.5 billion years, and more than \u2154 of that time was spent on perfecting the cell into the fundamental universal component of life that subsequently empowered the explosive evolution of complex multicellular organisms.\nThis talk will draw ideas from one of the most miraculous structures of our Universe - one which has withstood eons of evolution - and show you the striking resemblance between a cell and an instance object. This newly gained insight will point us to a new approach to class composition other than traditional mixins or traits. We\u2019ll then implement this mechanism using advanced language constructs in ES2015 and beyond, and see how it may help to catalyze the Cambrian explosion of next generation JavaScript apps.\nAfter studying chemistry and molecular biology and working as a telescope operator on Mauna Loa trying to be astrophysical, the adventurous journey of G. Kay Lee is now on hiatus since he has found his inner tranquility in being a frontend artisan. He\u2019s one of the coorganizers of AngularJS.tw, the author of ngStorage, a proponent of ES2015+, and a staff engineer at KKBOX.\n\nJSConf.Asia - Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore - 19 November 2015.\n\nSource: http://2015.jsconf.asia\nSlides: http://slides.com/gsklee/bio-inspired-frontend-engineering#/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
