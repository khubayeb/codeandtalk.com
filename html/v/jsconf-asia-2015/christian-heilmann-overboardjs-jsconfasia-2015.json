{"description": "There's a daily cool new thing in the world of JavaScript you need to know or you will fall behind. Or at least that is how it feels like. Don't feel bad, don't get frustrated.\nJavaScript is a hot topic and we love to build with it. It gives us control, it allows us to do things our way instead of waiting for browsers and it makes us more efficient. However, there is a flipside to that. It is almost impossible to keep up with the speed of innovation. In this talk you'll learn how we can use JavaScript, how to avoid over-using it and what you can do to play on the bleeding edge without feeling lost.\nChris has dedicated a lot of his time making the web better. Originally coming from a radio journalism background, he built his first web site from scratch around 1997 and spent the following years working on lots of large, international web sites. He then spent a few years in Yahoo building products and explaining and training people including Yahoo Answers, Search, Local and Maps. He then worked at Mozilla moving HTML5 support forward and advocating Firefox OS as an open alternative to closed mobile systems. Chris wrote two and contributed to eight books on web development and wrote many articles and hundreds of blog posts for Ajaxian, Smashing Magazine, Yahoo, Mozilla, ScriptJunkie and many more. He also wrote the Developer Evangelism Handbook in use in many companies to coach evangelists. He is currently working with the Microsoft Edge team as a Program Manager for Developer Outreach.\n\nJSConf.Asia - Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore - 19 November 2015.\n\nSource: http://2015.jsconf.asia\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/cheilmann/overboardjs-where-are-we-going-with-with-jsconfasia-devfestasia\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
