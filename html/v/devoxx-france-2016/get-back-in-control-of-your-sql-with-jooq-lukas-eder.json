{"description": "Java does not provide an API to directly support the expressiveness and power of SQL. All attention is given to object-relational mapping and abstractions on a higher level, such as OQL, HQL, JPQL, CriteriaQuery.\n\njOOQ is a dual-licensed Open Source product filling this gap. It implements SQL itself as a type safe domain-specific language in Java.\n\njOOQ is a good choice in a Java application where SQL and its proprietary features of the database in use are important. It shows, how a modern domain-specific language can greatly increase developer productivity, internalising SQL into Java.", "event": {"name": "Devoxx France 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-france-2016", "twitter": "DevoxxFR", "url": "http://www.devoxx.fr/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "get-back-in-control-of-your-sql-with-jooq-lukas-eder", "length": "45:13", "likes": "7", "recorded": "2016-04-20", "short_description": "Java does not provide an API to directly support the expressiveness and power of SQL.
