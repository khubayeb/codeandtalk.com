For some people microservices is \"the next big thing\", whereas for others it's simply a lightweight evolution of the big service-oriented architectures that we saw 10 years ago \"done right\u201d. Microservices is by no means a silver bullet though, and the design thinking required to create a good microservices architecture is the same as that needed to create a well structured monolith.
