{"description": "With microservices, polyglot and DevOps on the rise, where are we at with testing? Does it bring more complexity and make our testing effort harder or maybe in contrary; it actually helps us write better tests easier?\n\nIn this session, we will be exploring not only how we can do our testing in this new world, but also how the new world can help us test better.\n\nMeet Arquillian Cube and Q.\n\nWe will take a close look at topics varying from polyglot services, orchestrated microservices to system scale testing.
