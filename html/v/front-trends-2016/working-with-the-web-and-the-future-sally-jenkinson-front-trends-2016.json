How do we prepare for the unknowns and constant shifts in technology; what can we do to progress the evolution of the web itself; how do we, as individuals, ensure that our skills are as relevant as ever in this rapidly changing world?\n\nIn this talk we\u2019ll look at why the future is important, plus past visions of the future, including those from the world of science fiction.
