{"description": "Clojure is built upon a foundation of simplicity, and in the Clojure community simplicity is the most prized attribute a library or application can have. Unfortunately, there isn't much consensus on what simplicity looks like in real code and in applications that are, by nature, complex. This talk further unpacks the definition and practice of simplicity, with plenty of real-world examples and advice to move toward simplicity in meaningful, practical ways. It also revisits the relationship between ease and simplicity and advocates for ease as a complimentary attribute.\n\nSlides: http://clojutre.org/2015/slides/Simplicity-In-Practice.pdf", "event": {"name": "ClojuTRE 2015", "nickname": "clojutre-2015", "twitter": "clojutre", "url": "http://clojutre.org/2015/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "simplicity-in-practice-luke-vanderhart", "length": "30:48", "likes": "32", "recorded": "2015-09-11", "short_description": "Clojure is built upon a foundation of simplicity, and in the Clojure community simplicity is the most prized attribute a library", "speaker_twitters": " @levanderhart", "speakers": {"luke-vanderhart": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Durham, NC, USA", "github": "levand", "name": "Luke VanderHart", "twitter": "levanderhart"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Clojure West 2015", "nickname": "clojurewest-2015", "twitter": "ClojureWest", "url": "http://clojurewest.org/speakers-2015"}, "filename": "luke-vanderhart-the-reactjs-landscape", "recorded": "2015-04-20", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oRmj3IUkRVk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The ReactJS Landscape"}, {"event": {"name": "ClojuTRE 2015", "nickname": "clojutre-2015", "twitter": "clojutre", "url": "http://clojutre.org/2015/"}, "filename": "simplicity-in-practice-luke-vanderhart", "recorded": "2015-09-11", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2YmmfS5YTQ0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Simplicity in Practice"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2YmmfS5YTQ0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Simplicity in Practice", "tweet_video": "Simplicity%20in%20Practice%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/clojutre-2015/simplicity-in-practice-luke-vanderhart%20presented%20%40clojutre%20by%20%40levanderhart", "videos": [{"code": "2YmmfS5YTQ0", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "2573"}
