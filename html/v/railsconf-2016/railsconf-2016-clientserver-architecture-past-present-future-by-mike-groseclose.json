{"description": "Client/Server Architecture: Past, Present, & Future By Mike Groseclose The client/server architecture that powers much of the web is evolving. Full stack, monolithic, apps are becoming a thing of the past as new requirements have forced us to think differently about how we build apps. New client/server architectures create a clear separation of concerns between the server and the client.\n\nAs developers, we have the ability to create the new abstractions that will power the web. Understanding the past, present, and future of the client/server help us to become more active participants in the future ecosystem for building web applications.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/JM6K/", "event": {"name": "RailsConf 2016", "nickname": "railsconf-2016", "twitter": "railsconf", "url": "http://railsconf.com/2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "railsconf-2016-clientserver-architecture-past-present-future-by-mike-groseclose", "length": "23:17", "likes": "14", "recorded": "2016-05-04", "short_description": "Client/Server Architecture: Past, Present, & Future By Mike Groseclose The client/server architecture that powers much of the we", "speaker_twitters": " @mikrofusion", "speakers": {"mike-groseclose": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Tucson, AZ, USA", "github": "mikrofusion", "name": "Mike Groseclose", "twitter": "mikrofusion"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "RailsConf 2016", "nickname": "railsconf-2016", "twitter": "railsconf", "url": "http://railsconf.com/2016"}, "filename": "railsconf-2016-clientserver-architecture-past-present-future-by-mike-groseclose", "recorded": "2016-05-04", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ZqQRUWkomk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Client/Server Architecture: Past, Present, & Future"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ZqQRUWkomk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Client/Server Architecture: Past, Present, & Future", "tweet_video": "Client/Server%20Architecture%3A%20Past%2C%20Present%2C%20%26%20Future%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/railsconf-2016/railsconf-2016-clientserver-architecture-past-present-future-by-mike-groseclose%20presented%20%40railsconf%20by%20%40mikrofusion", "videos": [{"code": "-ZqQRUWkomk", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "741"}
