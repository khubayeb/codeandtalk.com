{"description": "Storytelling with Code by Michael Rau\n\nHow can you tell a story using only email, a laser printer, voicemail? Last year I created an immersive experience for one audience member in a standard office cubicle. The piece used a rails app and some other custom software and no live actors to tell a story about office culture. This talk focuses on the techniques of digital storytelling, my process of developing the story as I wrote the code, and the strategies I used to create an emotional connection with a user. If you are interested in the intersection between stories, software, game design and narrative design, this talk is for you!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/JvLm/", "event": {"name": "RailsConf 2016", "nickname": "railsconf-2016", "twitter": "railsconf", "url": "http://railsconf.com/2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "railsconf-2016-storytelling-with-code-by-michael-rau", "length": "34:07", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-05-04", "short_description": "Storytelling with Code by Michael Rau How can you tell a story using only email, a laser printer, voicemail?
