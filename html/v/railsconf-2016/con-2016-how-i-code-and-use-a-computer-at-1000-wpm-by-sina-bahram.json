{"description": "How I Code and Use a Computer at 1,000 WPM!! By Sina Bahram\n\nI use a computer very differently than most people, because I'm blind. When I'm surfing the web, tweeting, checking email, reading the news, and writing code, I'm doing so because a program called a screen reader is reading me what's on the screen. I happen to listen to it read me this text at a thousand words per minute! Join me in listening to how I experience some common user interfaces. Yes, I'll slow it down for you. I also have a challenge for everyone in the audience. Can you get through a day only using the keyboard? What about not looking at your screen?\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/KWNs/", "event": {"name": "RailsConf 2016", "nickname": "railsconf-2016", "twitter": "railsconf", "url": "http://railsconf.com/2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "con-2016-how-i-code-and-use-a-computer-at-1000-wpm-by-sina-bahram", "length": "13:29", "likes": "68", "recorded": "2016-05-04", "short_description": "How I Code and Use a Computer at 1,000 WPM!!
