{"description": "This talk illustrates the development techniques, Ruby patterns and best practices we adopt at DNSimple to develop new features and ensure long-term maintainability of our codebase. It also features how we used Lotus to develop the new API as a standalone Rack app mounted under the Rails router.\n\nTwo years ago we started a major redesign of our REST API with the goal to decouple it from our main Rails application and expose all the main features via API. It was not a trivial task, but still feasible due to the guidelines we adopted in the last 6 years to structure our Rails application.", "event": {"name": "RailsConf 2016", "nickname": "railsconf-2016", "twitter": "railsconf", "url": "http://railsconf.com/2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "railsconf-2016-developing-and-maintaining-a-platform-with-rails-and-lotus-by-simone-carletti", "length": "36:52", "likes": "14", "recorded": "2016-05-04", "short_description": "This talk illustrates the development techniques, Ruby patterns and best practices we adopt at DNSimple to develop new features ", "speaker_twitters": " @weppos", "speakers": {"simone-carletti": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Rome, Italy", "github": "weppos", "home": "https://simonecarletti.com/", "name": "Simone Carletti", "twitter": "weppos"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "RailsConf 2016", "nickname": "railsconf-2016", "twitter": "railsconf", "url": "http://railsconf.com/2016"}, "filename": "railsconf-2016-developing-and-maintaining-a-platform-with-rails-and-lotus-by-simone-carletti", "recorded": "2016-05-04", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FkWt7ep5XRM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Developing and Maintaining a Platform With Rails and Lotus"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FkWt7ep5XRM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Developing and Maintaining a Platform With Rails and Lotus", "tweet_video": "Developing%20and%20Maintaining%20a%20Platform%20With%20Rails%20and%20Lotus%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/railsconf-2016/railsconf-2016-developing-and-maintaining-a-platform-with-rails-and-lotus-by-simone-carletti%20presented%20%40railsconf%20by%20%40weppos", "videos": [{"code": "FkWt7ep5XRM", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "830"}
