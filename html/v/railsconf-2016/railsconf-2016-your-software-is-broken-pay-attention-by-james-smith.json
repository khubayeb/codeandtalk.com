{"abstract": "http://railsconf.com/2016/program/sessions#prop_2168", "description": "Your team has been tasked with releasing new and better versions of your product at record speed. But the risk of moving quickly is things break in production and users abandon your buggy app. To stay competitive, you can't just ship fast - you also have to solve for quality.\n\nWe'll rethink what it means to actively monitor your application in production so your team can ship fast with confidence. With the right tooling, workflow, and organizational structures, you don't have to sacrifice release times or stability. When things break, you'll be able to fix errors before they impact your users.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/J37Y/", "event": {"name": "RailsConf 2016", "nickname": "railsconf-2016", "twitter": "railsconf", "url": "http://railsconf.com/2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "railsconf-2016-your-software-is-broken-pay-attention-by-james-smith", "length": "36:50", "likes": "4", "recorded": "2016-05-04", "short_description": "Your team has been tasked with releasing new and better versions of your product at record speed.
