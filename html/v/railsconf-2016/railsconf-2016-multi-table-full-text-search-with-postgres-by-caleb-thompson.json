{"description": "Searching content across multiple database tables and columns doesn't have to suck. Thanks to Postgres, rolling your own search isn't difficult. Following an actual feature evolution I worked on for a client, we will start with a search feature that queries a single column with LIKE and build up to a SQL-heavy solution for finding results across multiple columns and tables using database views. We will look at optimizing the query time and why this could be a better solution over introducing extra dependencies which clutter your code and need to be stubbed in tests.", "event": {"name": "RailsConf 2016", "nickname": "railsconf-2016", "twitter": "railsconf", "url": "http://railsconf.com/2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "railsconf-2016-multi-table-full-text-search-with-postgres-by-caleb-thompson", "length": "27:19", "likes": "11", "recorded": "2016-05-04", "short_description": "Searching content across multiple database tables and columns doesn't have to suck.
