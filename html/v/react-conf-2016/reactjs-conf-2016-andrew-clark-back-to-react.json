If in ten years we're no longer using React, we'll likely be using something similar. You can already see this in how pre-React libraries like Ember and Angular have pivoted in the wake of React's two big innovations: a declarative component model, and unidirectional data flow.\n\nBut it's even more clear when looking at the post-React libraries, which use functional programming concepts to provide powerful architectures for state management.
