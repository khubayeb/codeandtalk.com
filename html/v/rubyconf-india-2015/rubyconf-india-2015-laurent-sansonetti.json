{"description": "The Ruby Community in India together with the Innovation & Technology Trust presents RubyConf India 2014 on March 22nd and 23rd in Goa, India. This is a great opportunity for Ruby enthusiasts to brainstorm, network and learn about the latest technology changes first-hand.  \n\nThis is the fifth edition of RubyConf to be hosted in India.\n\nFor the un-initiated, Ruby is an open source dynamic language that offers an ideal development environment for Agile practitioners. It has one of the most active open source communities worldwide which produces and supports tools and projects like \"Ruby on Rails\" - a powerful web application development framework that works well on different platforms, and significantly reduces time-to-market and operating costs.\n\nRubyConf India 2014 is also made possible by a grant from Ruby Central Inc -- an international non-profit dedicated to the advocacy of the Ruby programming language across the globe.  We welcome further support and sponsorship from the Ruby ecosystem.", "event": {"name": "RubyConf India 2015", "nickname": "rubyconf-india-2015", "twitter": "rubyconfindia", "url": "https://github.com/rubyconfindia/rci2015"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "rubyconf-india-2015-laurent-sansonetti", "length": "28:17", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2015-04-03", "short_description": "The Ruby Community in India together with the Innovation & Technology Trust presents RubyConf India 2014 on March 22nd and 23rd ", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iC50uo_F4d8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "RubyConf India 2015 - Laurent Sansonetti", "tweet_video": "RubyConf%20India%202015%20-%20Laurent%20Sansonetti%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/rubyconf-india-2015/rubyconf-india-2015-laurent-sansonetti%20presented%20%40rubyconfindia", "videos": [{"code": "iC50uo_F4d8", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "40"}
