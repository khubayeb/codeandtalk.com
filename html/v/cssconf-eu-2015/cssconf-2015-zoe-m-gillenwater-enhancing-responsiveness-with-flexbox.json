{"description": "\"Enhancing Responsiveness With Flexbox\": Flexbox and responsive web design go great together, like peanut butter and jelly! Flexbox gives you more control over the things you care about in a responsive layout and lets you create much morecomplex and reliable layouts than you can with floats, table display, or inline-block. All with far less CSS.\n\nIn this talk, you\u2019ll learn what flexbox features are particularly suited to responsive layouts and how you can harness them by applying flexbox as a progressive enhancement. We\u2019ll look at examples of responsive page components and patterns that you can enhance further by layering flexbox on top of other layout methods, ensuring all users get a good experience.\n\nZoe is a senior designer for Booking.com. She is the author of two books on CSS and visual web design, and she recently wrote the chapter on flexbox for Smashing Magazine\u2019s new Real-Life Responsive Web Design book.\n\nhttp://2015.cssconf.eu/", "event": {"name": "CSSConf EU 2015", "nickname": "cssconf-eu-2015", "twitter": "cssconfeu", "url": "http://2015.cssconf.eu/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "cssconf-2015-zoe-m-gillenwater-enhancing-responsiveness-with-flexbox", "length": "37:14", "likes": 0, "recorded": "2015-09-26", "short_description": "Enhancing Responsiveness With Flexbox: Flexbox and responsive web design go great together, like peanut butter and jelly!
