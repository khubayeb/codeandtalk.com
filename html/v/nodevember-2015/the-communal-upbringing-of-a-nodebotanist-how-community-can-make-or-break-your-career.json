{"description": "Kassandra Perch\nThere are high points and low points to any career, but I think we can all agree very few of us work in a total vaccuum; using only code we and our teammates write, learning only by reading books, etc. At some point, you&CloseCurlyQuote;ll read a blog post, use an open-source library. We learn how to pull request, we share our side-projects: rarely anymore is our work entirely secluded from public eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of this are more staggering than you&CloseCurlyQuote;d think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This talk is about how our interactions with each other as people on the internet shape the world and culture we work in on a daily basis. It&CloseCurlyQuote;s about how we are encourging or destroying the next big thing&ndash; and what we can do to improve our chances. I&CloseCurlyQuote;ll use anecdotes from my own career, and stories borrowed with permission from others, to illustrate how we can change our culture, because we shape it with every interaction we have.&lt;/p&gt;", "event": {"name": "Nodevember 2015", "nickname": "nodevember-2015", "twitter": "nodevember", "url": "http://lanyrd.com/2015/nodevember/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "the-communal-upbringing-of-a-nodebotanist-how-community-can-make-or-break-your-career", "length": "22:06", "likes": "9", "recorded": "2015-11-14", "short_description": "Kassandra Perch There are high points and low points to any career, but I think we can all agree very few of us work in a total ", "speaker_twitters": " @nodebotanist", "speakers": {"kassandra-perch": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Austin, TX, USA", "github": "nodebotanist", "home": "http://nodebotani.st/", "name": "Kassandra Perch", "twitter": "nodebotanist"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Empire Node 2015", "nickname": "empirenode-2015", "twitter": "empirenode", "url": "http://2015.empirenode.org/"}, "filename": "9-thin-client-nodebots-and-the-future-of-js-in-iot-kassandra-perch", "recorded": "2015-10-23", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WmjOrGJIxgo/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Thin Client NodeBots and the future of JS in IoT"}, {"event": {"name": "NodeConf London 2016", "nickname": "nodeconf-london-2016", "twitter": "nodeconf_london", "url": "http://london.nodeconf.com/"}, "filename": "robots-code-and-people-kas-perch", "recorded": "2016-05-11", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/edYnouynBxg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Robots, code and people"}, {"event": {"name": "Nodevember 2015", "nickname": "nodevember-2015", "twitter": "nodevember", "url": "http://lanyrd.com/2015/nodevember/"}, "filename": "the-communal-upbringing-of-a-nodebotanist-how-community-can-make-or-break-your-career", "recorded": "2015-11-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tBRGMcdAKzs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The communal upbringing of a Nodebotanist: How community can make or break your career."}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tBRGMcdAKzs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The communal upbringing of a Nodebotanist: How community can make or break your career.", "tweet_video": "The%20communal%20upbringing%20of%20a%20Nodebotanist%3A%20How%20community%20can%20make%20or%20break%20your%20career.%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/nodevember-2015/the-communal-upbringing-of-a-nodebotanist-how-community-can-make-or-break-your-career%20presented%20%40nodevember%20by%20%40nodebotanist", "videos": [{"code": "tBRGMcdAKzs", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "7844"}
