{"description": "Jeff Barczewski\n\nInstead of building monolithic applications, architecting functionality as microservices can give you new flexibility and scalability. Microservices allow you to keep functionality focused and compartmentalized. They can allow architectures with varying technology and languages.\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll showcase a few ways you can create and use microservices with Node.js using Hapi for REST style microservices or Redis for queued microservices. I\u2019ll explain some of the practical advantages this approach provides.", "event": {"name": "Nodevember 2015", "nickname": "nodevember-2015", "twitter": "nodevember", "url": "http://lanyrd.com/2015/nodevember/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "building-simple-nodejs-microservices-using-hapi-and-redis", "length": "31:12", "likes": "49", "recorded": "2015-11-14", "short_description": "Jeff Barczewski Instead of building monolithic applications, architecting functionality as microservices can give you new flexib", "speaker_twitters": " @jeffbski", "speakers": {"jeff-barczewski": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "St. Louis, MO, USA", "github": "jeffbski", "home": "http://codewinds.com/", "name": "Jeff Barczewski", "twitter": "jeffbski"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Nodevember 2015", "nickname": "nodevember-2015", "twitter": "nodevember", "url": "http://lanyrd.com/2015/nodevember/"}, "filename": "building-simple-nodejs-microservices-using-hapi-and-redis", "recorded": "2015-11-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kQQGFvnMdbw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Building simple Node.js microservices using Hapi and Redis"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kQQGFvnMdbw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Building simple Node.js microservices using Hapi and Redis", "tweet_video": "Building%20simple%20Node.js%20microservices%20using%20Hapi%20and%20Redis%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/nodevember-2015/building-simple-nodejs-microservices-using-hapi-and-redis%20presented%20%40nodevember%20by%20%40jeffbski", "videos": [{"code": "kQQGFvnMdbw", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "5067"}
