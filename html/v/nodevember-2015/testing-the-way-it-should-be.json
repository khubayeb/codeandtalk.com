{"description": "Brian Mann\n&lt;p&gt;Testing is the essential bedrock of software, and we can all agree it&CloseCurlyQuote;s a must-have. But when we talk about writing tests for the front-end, most developers immediately run into several challenges:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testing environments take too long to setup.&lt;li&gt;Tests end up extremely brittle and randomly fail.&lt;li&gt;Error messages are indirect and increase the time it takes to debug.&lt;li&gt;There isn&CloseCurlyQuote;t an easy test-driven development (TDD) process available.&lt;li&gt;Testing through a console fails to give full visibility on why a test failed.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Brian Mann will introduce a new JavaScript testing tool, Cypress.io, which solves the hardest challenges of testing modern, complex applications. You&CloseCurlyQuote;ll leave this talk re-energized and believe that testing can be a fun, enjoyable experience without the soul crushing pain it is today.&lt;/p&gt;", "event": {"name": "Nodevember 2015", "nickname": "nodevember-2015", "twitter": "nodevember", "url": "http://lanyrd.com/2015/nodevember/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "testing-the-way-it-should-be", "length": "01:00:32", "likes": "40", "recorded": "2015-11-14", "short_description": "Brian Mann &lt;p&gt;Testing is the essential bedrock of software, and we can all agree it&CloseCurlyQuote;s a must-have.
