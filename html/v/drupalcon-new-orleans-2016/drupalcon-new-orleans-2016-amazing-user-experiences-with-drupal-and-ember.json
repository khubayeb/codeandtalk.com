{"abstract": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/amazing-user-experiences-drupal-and-ember", "description": "When we combine Drupal 8's strong extensibility with Ember's strong conventions, something magic happens: we get Drupal sites that can be seamlessly extended into the browser, with access to a deep ecosystem of Ember addons that deliver amazing experiences out-of-the-box. All without writing any glue code.\n\nSee Drupal like you haven't seen it before, with gorgeous inter-page animations, Service Worker-driven offline capabilities, and in-site authoring tools with instant preview across multiple device sizes.\n\nA Javascript-curious Drupal developer should be able to come away from this session and add new capabilities to their existing D8 site that will make people say \"Wow!\"\n\nPrerequisites: intermediate experience as a Drupal developer, basic familiarity with Javascript, and a willingness to rethink the boundaries of what Drupal can be.\n\nTopics presented:\n\nWhy Javascript circa 2016 is nothing like Javascript circa 2006, and the opportunites this creates.\nWhat is Ember and the Ember community? (We have a lot in common with the Drupal community!)\nDemo of new open source modules to easily integrate Ember into a Drupal site, with the ability to gradually and progressively move small pieces of functionality from PHP to Javascript, while still taking advantage of a persistent, in-browser application.\nWalkthrough of extending a D8 site to show off animation, interactive editing, and offline capabilities (all source code provided).", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-amazing-user-experiences-with-drupal-and-ember", "length": "45:04", "likes": "52", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "When we combine Drupal 8's strong extensibility with Ember's strong conventions, something magic happens: we get Drupal sites th", "speaker_twitters": " @eaf4", "speakers": {"edward-faulkner": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Cambridge, MA, USA", "github": "ef4", "home": "http://eaf4.com/", "name": "Edward Faulkner", "twitter": "eaf4"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-amazing-user-experiences-with-drupal-and-ember", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O12qBp1lWUc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Amazing User Experiences with Drupal and Ember"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O12qBp1lWUc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Amazing User Experiences with Drupal and Ember", "tweet_video": "Amazing%20User%20Experiences%20with%20Drupal%20and%20Ember%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-amazing-user-experiences-with-drupal-and-ember%20presented%20%40drupalconNA%20by%20%40eaf4", "videos": [{"code": "O12qBp1lWUc", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "3238"}
