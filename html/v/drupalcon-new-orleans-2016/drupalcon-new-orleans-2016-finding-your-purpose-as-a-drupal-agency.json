However, growth in demand for Drupal services slowed in 2015 as many customers chose to wait for the impending release of Drupal 8. At the same time, industry consolidation and commoditization led to a downward pressure in rates for Drupal services. The result was a challenging year for many firms in the Drupal ecosystem. \n\nDuring challenging times, companies need to be able to articulate and focus on their core values, principles, and purpose. By focusing on long term goals and prioritizing them over short-term gains they\u2019re better equipped to put employees and customers first and retain the flexibility needed to thrive in an ever-changing business landscape.\n\nIn this session, we\u2019ll talk about:\nWhat values, principles, and purpose are and why they\u2019re important to your company, especially during challenging times.\nHow to develop and articulate your company\u2019s values, principles, and purpose.\nHow to ensure that your company's values are consistent with your culture.\nHow to inspire your team to thrive as part of a purpose-driven organization.\nThe goal will be to provide those who are involved in running Drupal service firms and agencies with the tools and perspective necessary to better understand not just the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d of their business, but also the \u201cwhy\u201d.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-finding-your-purpose-as-a-drupal-agency", "length": "50:39", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "This session explores how Drupal service firms and agencies can weather challenging times by focusing on their core values and p", "speaker_twitters": " @gdemet", "speakers": {"george-demet": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Evanston, IL, USA", "home": "https://www.palantir.net/", "name": "George DeMet", "twitter": "gdemet"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-improving-the-drupal-contributor-experience", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p4hJ5yEGKPc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Improving the Drupal Contributor Experience"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-finding-your-purpose-as-a-drupal-agency", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r0tqzEXeRQA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Finding Your Purpose as a Drupal Agency"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r0tqzEXeRQA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Finding Your Purpose as a Drupal Agency", "tweet_video": "Finding%20Your%20Purpose%20as%20a%20Drupal%20Agency%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-finding-your-purpose-as-a-drupal-agency%20presented%20%40drupalconNA%20by%20%40gdemet", "videos": [{"code": "r0tqzEXeRQA", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "99"}
