And, because links were maxing out, we couldn't even know just how much more capacity we needed for the next drawing. We had a couple days to prepare -- on a site that requires nearly instant invalidation to keep its content fresh.\n\nThere weren't many options we could turn around so quickly, so we talked to CDN providers and investigated other traffic-management options. It wasn't just an issue of getting a solution set up but also configuring, testing, and transitioning over with time to spare. This is the 48-hour story of surviving Google's catapult into the top 100 sites.\n\nIn this presentation, we will cover:\n\nServices and configurations you can deploy on short notice for site scaling, including costs and time-to-availability\nRunning HTTPS at scale (and avoiding man-in-the-middle attacks when communicating with the origin)\nConfiguring different cache lifetimes along the stack to allow precise invalidation control -- while still handling spikes elegantly\nOrigin shields: balancing geographic proximity with hitting the cache\nHow HTTP-standard Surrogate-Control headers manage differing cache lifetimes along the stack\nUsing Varnish's grace mode (in this case via Fastly) as a Plan B if the origin experiences issues\nAt each stage, making this all work well with Drupal's own cache invalidation hooks and header system", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-handling-powerball-night-scaling-patchcom", "length": "54:14", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Patch.com had a problem many would like to have after the first Powerball drawing: the Google juice was flowing so fast that sta", "speaker_twitters": " @DavidStrauss", "speakers": {"abe-brewster": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"name": "Abe Brewster"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-handling-powerball-night-scaling-patchcom", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h1zmA0aqVLE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Handling Powerball Night: Scaling Patch.com"}]}, "david-strauss": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "San Francisco, CA, USA", "github": "davidstrauss", "home": "https://pantheon.io/", "name": "David Strauss", "twitter": "DavidStrauss"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-cdns-more-than-just-performance-improvement", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ted5L1H_a8M/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "CDNs - more than just performance improvement"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-faster-and-more-scalable-than-memcacheredis-tiered-storage-with-lcache", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rezn59U9CAk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Faster and More Scalable than Memcache/Redis: Tiered Storage with LCache"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-agile-d8-builds-doing-the-most-without-php", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ds19kdVHoiU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Agile D8 Builds: Doing the Most Without PHP"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-handling-powerball-night-scaling-patchcom", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h1zmA0aqVLE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Handling Powerball Night: Scaling Patch.com"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h1zmA0aqVLE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Handling Powerball Night: Scaling Patch.com", "tweet_video": "DrupalCon%20New%20Orleans%202016%3A%20Handling%20Powerball%20Night%3A%20Scaling%20Patch.com%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-handling-powerball-night-scaling-patchcom%20presented%20%40drupalconNA%20by%20%40DavidStrauss", "videos": [{"code": "h1zmA0aqVLE", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "125"}
