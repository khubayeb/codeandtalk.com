More importantly, the execution of these metrics has led to successful growth-based strategies.  We will address a core set of topics predicated around creating greater operational efficiency. The subject matter will include:\n\n* Financials: revenue, margins, EBITDA, utilization, and managing cash flow.\n* Sales/Marketing: business development, creating brand awareness, and the best tools and resources to leverage.\n* Human Resources: culture, recruiting, and benefits.\n\nThe target audience of this session is threefold: (1.) pass the torch and help new Drupal owners be successful (2.) assist established owners to benchmark their data and (3.) provide insight to those who work at Drupal companies to provide a better understanding of what goes on behind the scenes.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-understanding-the-critical-metrics-for-your-drupal-business", "length": "58:11", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "When you first start a Drupal-centric business you will get a lot of well-intended advice like know your numbers.
