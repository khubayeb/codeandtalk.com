{"abstract": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/fifth-year-using-drupal-look-georgias-return-investment", "description": "Five years ago in 2011 the State of Georgia started planning to change its web publishing platform to Drupal. The plan was to move 55 websites from a proprietary content management system hosted at the state\u2019s data center to Drupal hosted in the cloud. The move was not only technical but also involved governance by asking 45 Georgia state agencies to make this change at the same time. The business case for a Drupal implementation promised efficiency benefits and cost savings for  the state's web presence. Now five years after Georgia moved to Drupal, how did the promise hold up?\n\nThis session will cover the following:\n\n\u00b7        A close look at Georgia\u2019s ROI on implementing Drupal\n\n\u00b7        How other organizations can plan for a large scale Drupal implementation\n\n\u00b7        The technical, business and end-user influences on Georgia's existing Drupal platform\n\n\u00b7        Managing a digital services team to support an enterprise\n\n\u00b7        Maintaining your Drupal platform post migration\n\nOther states, local governments or any organization looking to implement an enterprise Drupal solution will benefit from this session.\n\nNikhil is Director of GeorgiaGov Interactive, a division within the Georgia Technology Authority (GTA).
