It is sometimes difficult to imagine the scale and reach of this community unaided. Visualizations are a great tool that can visually and interactively convey the data and what it means.\n\nIt is a safe assumption to say that almost everyone in the vast Drupal community is present on drupal.org, which makes it a primary source for data on Drupal community. This data when viewed through meaningful dimensions has a lot to tell not just about the current state of affairs but what the community might look like in a few years. This is precisely what I have attempted to show using drustats.com - a visualization tool for data collected through drupal.org.\n\nIn this session, I will cover more visualizations that could help us understand:\n\nUsers and contributors (documentation, code, etc\u2026) in numbers\nGeographic reach of the Drupal community\nTrend of various contributions to drupal.org content and projects\nContributions to drupal.org split geographically and by other factors\nAnd more\nI also hope to discuss what data should we be collecting and how to portray contributions to the community and how to use the data to reward contributors and encourage contributions. At the end of the session, we would leave with:\n\nFacts and figures for Drupal community from drupal.org\nFood for thought on what the Drupal community might look like in a few years\nDiscussions and ideas on what to focus to encourage new contributors (code and non-code) and expand reach", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-visualizing-drupal-community-through-drupalorg", "length": "37:49", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Drupal is one of the largest communities in the open source world today.
