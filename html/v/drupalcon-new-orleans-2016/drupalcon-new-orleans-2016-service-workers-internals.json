Service workers provide the technical foundation that all these features will rely on.\n\nService worker is collection of APIs, that come together to give web applications a set of new and richer capabilities that brings it on par and in cases like offline support trumps over native capabilities.\n\nIn Drupal Ecosystem this is still unexplored. In this session we will dig into the foundations of services workers api with demos and code walk throughs. Also we will do a deep dive into internals to see how we can use it with Drupal 8 for a rich user experience.\n\n\n\nOutLine of this session - \n\nService Worker Standalone\n\n Background and capabilities\n\n Set up for your application\n\n Service workers - LifeCycle\n\n Updating a Service worker\n\n Browser Compatibility\n\nDemos - To show what we can do using service workers api\n\n Implementing push notifications\n\n Offline Web Experience\n\n Background Sync\n\nIntegration possibilities with Drupal 8.\n\n\nP.S -- There was lot of excitement in Service workers BoF that happened in Drupalcon Asia\n\nAudience Level - This session would be a mixed beginner and intermidiate level.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-service-workers-internals", "length": "01:03:11", "likes": "3", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Rich offline experiences, periodic background syncs, push notifications\u2014 functionality that would normally require a native appl", "speaker_twitters": " @piyuesh23 @saket_kmr", "speakers": {"piyuesh-kumar": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Pune, India", "github": "piyuesh23", "name": "Piyuesh Kumar", "twitter": "piyuesh23"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-service-workers-internals", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gKNR4rLdUU8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Service Workers Internals"}]}, "saket-kumar": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "India", "github": "saki007ster", "home": "https://about.me/saki007ster", "name": "Saket Kumar", "twitter": "saket_kmr"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-exploring-drupal-8-frontend-landscape-through-polymer", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QJlD0fyCEmE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Exploring Drupal 8 Frontend landscape through Polymer"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-service-workers-internals", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gKNR4rLdUU8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Service Workers Internals"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gKNR4rLdUU8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Service Workers Internals", "tweet_video": "Service%20Workers%20Internals%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-service-workers-internals%20presented%20%40drupalconNA%20by%20%40piyuesh23%20by%20%40saket_kmr", "videos": [{"code": "gKNR4rLdUU8", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "262"}
