The platform's design and Drupal development now connects the best ideas in international development directly with the resources they need for them to become a reality. \nBuilt on Drupal 7 and Autoscaled on AWS, Forum One was able to ensure that as the Global Innovation community grew that Drupal was able to handle the traffic. A robust site built using features such as integrated Solr search with enhanced More Like This, Long form content authoring, and the ability to quickly spin up microsites for Exchange partners. \n\nUtilizing Pattern Lab for creating real-time designs that the client (USAID's Innovation Lab and DAI) was able to review allowed us to implement a large scale theme within 2 weeks -  something quite unheard of in the traditional Drupal theming community. Integrating Pattern Lab within the theme structure allows for continuous development and deployment as new feature requests are proposed. \n\nThe Exchange community quickly grew to more than 3,000 users, with 1,000 of those joining in the first two months after the open beta release in September 2015. More than 350 member organizations and counting are using the Exchange to support hundreds of innovations that are changing the face of international development. \n\nThis session will cover:\n\nRapid Drupal Development: creating a powerful platform in just 100 days\nUsing Pattern Lab to create real-time designs\nUsing Solr search with enhanced More Like This, Long form content authoring, and microsites\nLevel of knowledge required to attend: this session caters to both beginner and advanced users of Drupal.\n\n2) Weather.com & Smartling:\n\nSPEAKERS: PATRICK BURCH & VISHAL SHRIVASTAVA \n\nLocalizing content in the MediaCurrent Presentation Framework\n\nWeather\u2019s migration to Drupal via Presentation Framework presented 3 key challenges for translation:\nHandling resources of angular modules\nIntegrating translation seamlessly into the development lifecycle\nAutomating translations upon the provisioning of a new drupal installation or when installing new modules\nIn this in-depth case study, learn how weather.com and Smartling solved this challenges and created a fully automated translation workflow for multilingual site delivery.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-reinventing-international-development-with-rapid-drupal-development", "length": "50:00", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "1) Reinventing International Development With Rapid Drupal Development SPEAKER: CHAZ.CHUMLEY Experience: Intermediate Drupal Ver", "speaker_twitters": " @patrick_burch @chazchumley", "speakers": {"chaz-chumley": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "USA", "github": "chazchumley", "home": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/chazchumley", "name": "Chaz Chumley", "twitter": "chazchumley"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-streamlined-front-end-development-with-pattern-lab-and-twig", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Og0ICdASO_Y/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Streamlined Front-end Development with Pattern Lab and Twig"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-reinventing-international-development-with-rapid-drupal-development", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7I0BrzrkRHM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Reinventing International Development With Rapid Drupal Development"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-the-big-easy-streamlined-front-end-development", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-sQD7_2nDuI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Big Easy: Streamlined Front-end Development"}]}, "patrick-burch": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "USA", "github": "patpluspun", "name": "Patrick Burch", "twitter": "patrick_burch"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-reinventing-international-development-with-rapid-drupal-development", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7I0BrzrkRHM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Reinventing International Development With Rapid Drupal Development"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7I0BrzrkRHM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Reinventing International Development With Rapid Drupal Development", "tweet_video": "Reinventing%20International%20Development%20With%20Rapid%20Drupal%20Development%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-reinventing-international-development-with-rapid-drupal-development%20presented%20%40drupalconNA%20by%20%40patrick_burch%20by%20%40chazchumley", "videos": [{"code": "7I0BrzrkRHM", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "142"}
