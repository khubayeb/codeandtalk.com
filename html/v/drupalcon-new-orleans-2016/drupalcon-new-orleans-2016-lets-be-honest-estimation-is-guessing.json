{"abstract": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/lets-be-honest-estimation-guessing", "description": "Everybody would love to spend weeks in a detailed discovery exercise; writing nitty gritty of the application in product backlog and thinking through on the application architecture before submitting the proposal. Unfortunately, dreams don\u2019t come true!\n\nGetting the estimation right in the sales cycle quickly (especially in early stages) is probably what strengthens any agency chance to win the project. So how you\u2019d go about making your best shot with limited resources/time of your architects/developers?\n\nOur session would be focussed on below mentioned points; it would be a story with examples and demos:\n\nMaking the best use of early interactions; probing clients with questions to get the view of the application.\n\nBuilding initial set of stories/feature list (as a backlog)\n\nStory point estimation of the backlog (and not the hours!)\n\nDefine clear dark areas in the scope; calling them out early. Show clients the zeal to clarify the scope.  \n\nTranslating the estimation into a loading sheet; define the burn rate.\n\nGoto step 4; refine the scope again. Rinse, Repeat!\n\nCongratulations! You\u2019ve shown clear investment in the project with the client. You\u2019re already way ahead in the game.\n\n\n\nEnsure that you let us know:\n\nWhat level of knowledge should attendees have before walking into your session\nThis session will be easy to understand for people with intermediate level knowledge of Project management and Sales. However the session should be open for beginners.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-lets-be-honest-estimation-is-guessing", "length": "57:21", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Everybody would love to spend weeks in a detailed discovery exercise; writing nitty gritty of the application in product backlog", "speaker_twitters": " @ashclimb", "speakers": {"ashwini-kumar": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Goa, India", "home": "http://beautiful7mind.wordpress.com/", "name": "Ashwini Kumar", "twitter": "ashclimb"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-dependency-injection-in-drupal-8", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0SdBVmxuCZg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Dependency injection in Drupal 8"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-lets-be-honest-estimation-is-guessing", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rcYYOquSk-Y/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Let's be honest: Estimation is guessing"}]}, "gaurav-mishra": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "India", "name": "Gaurav Mishra"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-lets-be-honest-estimation-is-guessing", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rcYYOquSk-Y/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Let's be honest: Estimation is guessing"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rcYYOquSk-Y/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Let's be honest: Estimation is guessing", "tweet_video": "Let%27s%20be%20honest%3A%20Estimation%20is%20guessing%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-lets-be-honest-estimation-is-guessing%20presented%20%40drupalconNA%20by%20%40ashclimb", "videos": [{"code": "rcYYOquSk-Y", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "229"}
