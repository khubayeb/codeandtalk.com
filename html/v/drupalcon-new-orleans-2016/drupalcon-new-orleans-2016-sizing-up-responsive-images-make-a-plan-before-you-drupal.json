Then, when I get home, those gorgeous cats absolutely must look fabulous on my large-screen high-resolution monitor, too.\n\nWhen there\u2019s a problem that involves cats, you can bet that Drupal is ready to help!\n\nDrupal 8 has built-in responsive images support based off of Drupal 7\u2019s contributed Picture and Breakpoint modules. Understanding how to use those modules without first making a plan could easily lead to a cat-tastrophe!\n\nSo we\u2019ll start not by reviewing every detail of the responsive images specification or every option you\u2019ll need on Drupal\u2019s configuration screen, but instead by studying cats. We\u2019ll look at how our cat photos fit into our site\u2019s layout. Once we understand that, we can plan how to create multiple versions of a cat photo. Then we can provide different size options based on the browser width and resolution. Best of all, we\u2019ll get Drupal to take care of that tedious work so we can spend more time with cats.\n\nDon\u2019t worry! No cats will be harmed or cloned in this process! Even though cloning cats would create a more purr-fect world.\n\nLearning objectives and outcomes:\n\nWe want our sites to shine with beautiful images that load quickly.\n\nTo do so, we\u2019ll first learn how to analyze how a particular type of image fits into a site\u2019s layout. Then we\u2019ll use that analysis to make a plan for the image file sizes we\u2019ll need at various viewport widths.\n\nOnce we have that plan, we\u2019ll learn how to let Drupal take care of generating the image files and writing the HTML markup we\u2019ll need for our responsive images solution. That includes learning how to do that today with Drupal 7\u2019s Picture and Breakpoint modules, as well as how to do so Drupal 8, which simplifies several key steps. We\u2019ll look at responsive image configuration and image style setup, field formatter settings as well as how to work with responsive images in preprocessor functions.\n\nWhile we will discuss the key concepts of the new responsive image specification, we won\u2019t be going into great detail on the history of how these specifications were developed. Instead we\u2019ll focus on practical lessons on how to make images more responsive with Drupal, based on Marc\u2019s experience as a front-end developer at Lullabot and as one of the co-maintainers of Drupal 8\u2019s Breakpoint and Responsive Image modules.\n\nSession focus:\n\nWhat sets this session apart from others is the focus on planning out which image file sizes you will need based on your site's layout. Figuring that out is the most challenging part of working with responsive images, and this session explains how to make those decisions in a sensible way.\n\nPrevious presentation video:\n\nVideo from 2015 Twin Cities Drupal Camp presentation", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-sizing-up-responsive-images-make-a-plan-before-you-drupal", "length": "01:09:38", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Fun fact: the web is powered by cat photos.
