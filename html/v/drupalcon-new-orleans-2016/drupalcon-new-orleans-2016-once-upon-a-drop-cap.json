{"abstract": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/once-upon-drop-cap-when-words-were-experience-letters-were-your-voice", "description": "What we have to say has always been intimately intertwined with how we say it. Design is about communicating those ideas and influencing users\u2019 behavior, so it follows that influence is imparted largely by how we design. For all our intellectual complexity, our brains are still wired to make near-instant judgements about the value and importance of the message we are receiving based on how that message appears.\n\nThankfully, most of us are still familiar enough with actual books to remember the feel of paper under our fingers, the smell of the ink, the elegant transitions from one idea to the next \u2013 all in service of the story. While pixels remain odorless, there\u2019s much more we can do than just deliver a digital message. Practiced typography transforms that message into a compelling experience. Let\u2019s take a journey forward through time and see where typography can take us.\n\nWe'll look at examples of ways type has been used to impact user experience throughout history, and how typography has evolved to work with varying screens and content. It's a fundamental change in what it means to practice typography, and critical to understand how it impacts how we design. We'll also explore a few of the technical considerations and capabilities available to help create better typographic systems that will work well into the future.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-once-upon-a-drop-cap", "length": "51:10", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "What we have to say has always been intimately intertwined with how we say it.
