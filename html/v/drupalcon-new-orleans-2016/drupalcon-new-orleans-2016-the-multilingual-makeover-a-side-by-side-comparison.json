{"abstract": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/multilingual-makeover-side-side-comparison-drupal-7-and-drupal-8", "description": "Hello! Ciao! Hola! Salom! Hai! Elo!\n\nWe live in a global, interconnected world, and building websites that support multiple languages and countries is good for marketing, conversions, and creating happy users. It does not, however, also mean you will have happy developers.\n\nDrupal 7 is notoriously hard for creating multilingual websites. Language support in D7 was bolted-on and adhoc and tends to require 20 to 30 extra modules and often a number of patches and custom workarounds as well. Drupal 7 multilingual configuration is ugly. And that's being kind.\n\nBut, Drupal has had a complete multilingual makeover! Enter Drupal 8. You might think we are talking about slapping on some makeup here, but we aren't.\n\nDefinition: A makeover is \"a complete reconstruction and renovation of something\"\nThe Drupal 8 Multilingual Initiative had quite a mess to untangle. The goal was to rebuild language support in Drupal from the ground up so that everything in Drupal understood language from the start. And, any custom or contributed modules or themes for Drupal 8 would reap the benefit of not really having to understand language support because it would just \"be there\". The results are amazing.\n\nThis session is a side-by-side comparison of ugly Drupal 7 configuration and beautiful Drupal 8 configuration. What took 20+ modules in Drupal 7, takes 4 in Drupal 8, with no workarounds, patches, or hacks.\n\nWe'll compare Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 configuration for:\n\nLanguage support\nUser interface translation\nContent translation\nConfiguration translation\nAnd more...\nIntended Audience\n\nAnyone building or managing multilingual sites would benefit from this session. You will walk away with knowledge of the how Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 multilingual configuration differs so you can prepare yourself for site building in either version.\n\nSkill Levels\n\nThis session is suitable for beginners or intermediates. If you are beginner, it is best if you understand Drupal basics such as content types, blocks, menus, and views. If you are an expert, don't forget to send your favorite multilingual module, tip, or horror story to @hook42inc on Twitter.\n\nAbout the Speakers\n\nAimee has been in the web world since the 90s working as a web architect and project manager dealing a variety of Enterprise content management systems.
