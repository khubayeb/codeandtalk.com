{"abstract": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/documentation-getting-overhaul", "description": "Having high-quality documentation available for Drupal.org is key to gaining wider adoption, growing the community, and the overall success of the Drupal project. I want to share the work related to documentation going on in the community, as well as some of our plans for continued improvement in the future.\n\nThe community, the Drupal Association, and the Documentation Working Group have all been hard at work improving both the processes and the tools we all use to manage our documentation. And we\u2019re making huge progress! This session is for anyone who wants to learn about these changes, and what to expect in the future.\n\nIn this session I want to share the progress being made on various initiatives. I\u2019ll start by discussing some of the pain-points that have been identified, and look at how the conversation has evolved over the last couple of years, and then I\u2019ll share information about the following initiatives that are addressing these pain-points.\n\nThe Drupal 8 user manual initiative\nUpdates to Drupal.org from the last year that make documentation pages easier to maintain\nIn progress changes to the information architecture of handbook pages\nUpcoming changes to Drupal.org that facilitate better collaboration, and maintainership of documentation pages\nFinally, I would like to make sure there is time left at the end of the session for others to share their ideas about how documentation could be further improved and to provide feedback on recent and proposed changes.\n\nThis is a topic I've talked about in these previoius sessions, Lets Talk Documentation, and Lets Keep Talking About Documentation. Both times leading to productive converations that have helped to inform much of the work taking place currently. And something I hope to continue with this discussion as well.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-documentation-is-getting-an-overhaul", "length": "01:05:04", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Having high-quality documentation available for Drupal.org is key to gaining wider adoption, growing the community, and the over", "speaker_twitters": " @eojthebrave @tvnweb", "speakers": {"joe-shindelar": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Minneapolis, MN, USA", "github": "eojthebrave", "home": "http://dreamformula.com/", "name": "Joe Shindelar", "twitter": "eojthebrave"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-documentation-is-getting-an-overhaul", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9KVfQV3Djd0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Documentation Is Getting An Overhaul"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-altering-extending-and-enhancing-drupal-8", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tMM-I70ksQA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Altering, Extending, and Enhancing Drupal 8"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-documentation-is-getting-an-overhaul", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sIsuh8ckrtc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Documentation Is Getting An Overhaul"}]}, "tatiana-ugriumova": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"github": "tatianaU21", "home": "https://another.ink/", "name": "Tatiana Ugriumova", "twitter": "tvnweb"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-documentation-is-getting-an-overhaul", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sIsuh8ckrtc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Documentation Is Getting An Overhaul"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-drupalorg-is-changing", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ReAkCdvmMqU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Drupal.org is changing"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sIsuh8ckrtc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Documentation Is Getting An Overhaul", "tweet_video": "Documentation%20Is%20Getting%20An%20Overhaul%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-documentation-is-getting-an-overhaul%20presented%20%40drupalconNA%20by%20%40eojthebrave%20by%20%40tvnweb", "videos": [{"code": "sIsuh8ckrtc", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "207"}
