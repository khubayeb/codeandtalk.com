Drupal 8 has added extensive support for accessibility in Core. From small changes like font size and colour contrast, to large changes like WAI-ARIA in core, Drupal 8 will make it easier to build an accessible site. For anyone trying to make a barrier-free website, it\u2019s important to understand the new features and how each can be used.\n\nAccessibility features reviewed will include:\n\nWAI-ARIA\nHTML5 and Improved Semantics\nColour Contrast and Low Vision\nAlt Tags and Defaults\nW3C's ATAG\nTables\nErrors\nUnfortunately, Drupal 8 isn\u2019t 100% accessible. It\u2019s a lot more accessible than anything else, but there are still a number of important issues that need to be addressed in Drupal Core to meet WCAG 2.0 AA and ATAG 2.0 guidelines. Mike will raise a number of places where there is room for improvements.\n\nBy attending this presentation you\u2019ll get an understanding of the challenges of web accessibility, Drupal 8\u2019s new features, and how the new capabilities benefit the web.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-how-drupal-8-makes-your-website-more-easily-accessible", "length": "01:01:46", "likes": "3", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Mike Gifford, Drupal 8\u2019s Core Accessibility Maintainer, will demonstrate a variety of accessibility features that Drupal 8.
