I will include example of code from Drupal 7 and where the very similar code lives in Drupal 8. \n\nIn addition I'll cover the essentials of implementing your own plugin if your module previously used an \"info\" hook and you want to join the new paradigm. You'll come away understanding plugin terminology and different ways plugins can be discovered,\n\nFinally,  you  leave feeling good that you'll never again implement one of these hooks by mistake again when you're writing a function in your module.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-drupal-8-where-did-the-code-go-from-info-hook-to-plugin", "length": "55:41", "likes": "2", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Looking at core and contrib modules for Drupal 8, you may be wondering where did the code go?.
