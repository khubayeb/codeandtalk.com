This tension should not go away, and it\u2019s possible to have healthy relationship where both teams understand each other\u2019s priorities and work together to serve the client as seamless and surprise-less of an experience as possible.  \n\nThe presentation will be a joint presentation between a seasoned veteran of project management, Ashleigh Thevenet, and of business development, Kyle Theobald.  It will not only touch on the problem as a whole in a light-hearted way, but also discuss tools and processes that can be used to smooth out the interaction between the departments and make sure the client gets optimum service.\n\nSome of the questions that will be answered during the talk:\n\nWhy this subject is likely the number one reason agencies fail or succeed to thrive?\nWhat are some of the tensions that exist and where do they come from?\n\nWhat are the priorities of each department and how does that lend to the problems we see?\n\nHow does the handling of intracompany communications affect the outcome for the client?\n\nWhat are the tools and approaches that make this better for everyone?\n\nAshleigh\u2019s speaking xp:\n\nhttps://www.drupal.org/u/ashleigh-thevenet\n\nHow Changing our Estimation Process Took our Project Endgame from WTF to FTW!
