{"abstract": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/bigpipe", "description": "Did you know that often the majority of the time spent generating a HTML page is spent on a few dynamic/uncacheable/personalized parts? Pages are only sent to the client after everything is rendered. Well, what if Drupal could start sending a page before it\u2019s fully finished? What if Drupal could let the browser start downloading CSS, JS, and images, and even make the majority of the page available for interaction while Drupal generates those uncacheable parts? Good news \u2014 it can!\n\nThis is where Drupal 8\u2019s improved architecture comes in: it allows us to do Facebook BigPipe-style rendering. You can now simply install the BigPipe module for Drupal 8.0 and see the difference for yourself. It has been included in Drupal 8.1 as an optional module (still marked experimental for now).\n\nIn this session, we will cover:\n\nThe ideas behind BigPipe\nHow to use BigPipe on your Drupal site\nHow Drupal is able to do this (high-level technical information)\nHow you can make your code BigPipe-compatible (technical details)\nWhat else is made possible thanks to the improved architecture in Drupal 8 (ESI etc.), without any custom code\n(We start with the basics/fundamentals, and gradually go deeper into how it works. Even non-Drupal people should be able to follow along.)", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-bigpipe", "length": "01:10:23", "likes": "10", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Did you know that often the majority of the time spent generating a HTML page is spent on a few dynamic/uncacheable/personalized", "speaker_twitters": " @wimleers @fabianfranz", "speakers": {"fabian-franz": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Weilheim, Gemany", "github": "LionsAd", "home": "http://www.lionsad.de/", "name": "Fabian Franz", "twitter": "fabianfranz"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-4x-high-performance-for-drupal-step-by-step-the-ultimate-beginners-guide", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6z0bZTuLZhw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "4x High Performance for Drupal - Step by Step - The ultimate beginner's guide"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon Dublin 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-dublin-2016", "twitter": "drupalconeur", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-dublin-2016-stream-your-way-to-success-bigpipe-refreshless-esi-ajax-and-more", "recorded": "2016-09-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/boW7pOOHmw4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Stream your way to Success: BigPipe, Refreshless, ESI, AJAX and more"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-bigpipe", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/spnFCx4lDGw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: BigPipe"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-lighting-talks-case-studies", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5PutFNzwIj8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Lighting Talks: Case Studies"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-the-future-of-drupal-performance-parallel-worlds", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ykrPYAGIYvU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The future of Drupal Performance - Parallel worlds"}]}, "wim-leers": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Belgium", "github": "wimleers", "home": "http://wimleers.com/", "name": "Wim Leers", "twitter": "wimleers"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-bigpipe", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/spnFCx4lDGw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: BigPipe"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/spnFCx4lDGw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: BigPipe", "tweet_video": "DrupalCon%20New%20Orleans%202016%3A%20BigPipe%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-bigpipe%20presented%20%40drupalconNA%20by%20%40wimleers%20by%20%40fabianfranz", "videos": [{"code": "spnFCx4lDGw", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "952"}
