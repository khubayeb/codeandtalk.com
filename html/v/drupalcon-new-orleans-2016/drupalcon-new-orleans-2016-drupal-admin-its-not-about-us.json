So why such a bum-rap? Despite how enabled developers are to customize the admin, as the sprints run out, the budget runs low, or a hard deadline approaches; the admin has a tendency to be one of the first things to get sidelined.\n\nThe most important step is to put yourself in the shoes of non-Drupal savvy. You must think like the stakeholders that will maintain the system as their job. What content will they frequently edit, when could they benefit from a custom list provided by views, when could one extra filter or column save them hours of work each week. We have the power to help get these folks home on time each evening, and it is in the best interest of the entire Drupal community that we make that a reality.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-drupal-admin-its-not-about-us", "length": "57:40", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Abstract: You can greatly increase client satisfaction by tailoring an administration experience based on their perspectives and", "speaker_twitters": " @squidhaven", "speakers": {"tom-martin": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Portland, OR, USA", "github": "doc-martin", "home": "http://www.squidhaven.com/", "name": "Tom Martin", "twitter": "squidhaven"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-drupal-admin-its-not-about-us", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KSe_AWq_muE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Drupal Admin: It's Not About Us"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KSe_AWq_muE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Drupal Admin: It's Not About Us", "tweet_video": "Drupal%20Admin%3A%20It%27s%20Not%20About%20Us%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-drupal-admin-its-not-about-us%20presented%20%40drupalconNA%20by%20%40squidhaven", "videos": [{"code": "KSe_AWq_muE", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "120"}
