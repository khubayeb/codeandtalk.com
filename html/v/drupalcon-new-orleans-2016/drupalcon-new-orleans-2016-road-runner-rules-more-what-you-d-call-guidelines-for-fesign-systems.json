With the increased popularity of pattern libraries and the Twig powered flexibility we\u2019ll be seeing in Drupal 8, we finally have the tools to create and deploy our own design systems.\n\nBut what is a design system, and how do we create them? What rules should it follow? How do I get my team on board?\n\nIn this talk I will be pulling wisdom and insight from my past two years of creating a design system for Redhat.com. I will explain what we call our \u201cRoad Runner Rules\u201d, which influence every piece of code that we write.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are a designer who wants to learn how to turn your visual language into a design system, or a developer who wants to create more modular components, you\u2019ll want to sit in on this session and learn from the successes and failures of a large scale Drupal design system.\n\n\n\nAfter the talk join our team in BOF room 291 for a hands on demo with the new Pattern Builder Module", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-road-runner-rules-more-what-you-d-call-guidelines-for-fesign-systems", "length": "57:26", "likes": "4", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could spend less time trying to style the markup we\u2019ve been handed, and more time creating a system o", "speaker_twitters": " @micahgodbolt", "speakers": {"micah-godbolt": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Seattle, WA, USA", "github": "micahgodbolt", "home": "https://www.micah.codes/", "name": "Micah Godbolt", "twitter": "micahgodbolt"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-road-runner-rules-more-what-you-d-call-guidelines-for-fesign-systems", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BAQUo2QM1kg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Road Runner Rules: More what you\u0092d call Guidelines for Design Systems"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BAQUo2QM1kg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Road Runner Rules: More what you\u0092d call Guidelines for Design Systems", "tweet_video": "Road%20Runner%20Rules%3A%20More%20what%20you%C2%92d%20call%20Guidelines%20for%20Design%20Systems%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-road-runner-rules-more-what-you-d-call-guidelines-for-fesign-systems%20presented%20%40drupalconNA%20by%20%40micahgodbolt", "videos": [{"code": "BAQUo2QM1kg", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "390"}
