Well, maybe this number isn't all it's cracked up to be.\n<p>\nLet's discuss challenges we face having such a large community.\nAre the processes around the Drupal project equipped to handle such a large number of contributors? Do we still experience growing pains? What problems are hidden by that large number, like the limited number high-end contributors and burnout.\nDoes it even make sense to strive for bigger numbers in all aspects of the community?\n<p>\nLet's also discuss ways we might shift our focus, like supporting smaller, more productive events, one-on-one mentoring programs to help nurture existing contributors, and other ways to make sure we get the most out of our limited volunteer hours and efforts.\n<p>\nThe long tail of Drupal 8.0 contribution\n<p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Over 3,000 contributors for D8, 954 for D7.</li>\n  <li>Both start to flatten around 200th contributor.</li>\n  <li>Burnout, turnover.</li>\n  <li>10 of the top 25 people are the same.</li>\n  <li>Of the remaining 15, 8 are in the the top 100 and 12 in the top 200.</li>\n  <li>70% have 1-2 credits, 60% for D7</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><q>It would be more important to enlarge the team of top developers who can solve the really hard problems than to add 1,000 more contributors.</q></li>\n  <li><q>Litte sprints with 5-10 people are more effective than huge ones with 500 people.</q></li>\n  <li><q>Local events and local mentorship is more beneficiant and more effective.</q></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\nAlso talking <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/xjm\">xjm</a> Drupal 8 release manager.\n<p>\nAlso talking Chris. <q>If the only purpose of the mentoring program is to find Unicorns then there might be better ways as well.</q>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult\">Cargo Cult</a>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/contributor-tasks\">contributor tasks</a>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Frustrations</h3>\nThere are a lot of people who trid contributing once but went away because of the frustration.\n\n<ol>\n   <li><q>34% People were frustrated with the complex issue queue process.</q></li>\n   <li><q>32% Bugs and patches don't get reviewed and fixed fast enough.</q></li>\n   <li><q>The size of the Drupal code-base is overwhelming and too complex to figure it out.</q></li>\n</ul>\n\n", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-is-size-just-a-number", "length": "01:01:18", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Drupal has one of the largest open source communities in the world, with Drupal 8 crediting over 3,000 individual contributors.
