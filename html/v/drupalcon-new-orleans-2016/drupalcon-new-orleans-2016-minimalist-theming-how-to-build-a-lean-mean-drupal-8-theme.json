The theme was often responsible for a lot of the cruft. We saw themes with excess code, too many template files, and not enough documentation. \n\nThe Drupal 8 theme layer provides new features like libraries and Twig blocks that can help us to build cleaner, better-organized themes. So now is a good time for themers to re-visit which theming techniques to use to create themes that are smaller, maintainable, and well organized.\n\nIn this session, we\u2019ll cover some of these features and look at specific examples of how to apply them in real-world themes:\n\nCreating libraries to load CSS and JS in different contexts\nExtending existing libraries\nUsing breakpoints consistently\nWhen to use view modes\nHow to use Twig blocks to reduce template code\nWhen to use templates vs. preprocess functions\nWhy/how to use theme settings", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-minimalist-theming-how-to-build-a-lean-mean-drupal-8-theme", "length": "55:42", "likes": "11", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Back in the Drupal 7 days (aka last year), we came across some pretty large, hard-to-maintain Drupal 7 sites.
