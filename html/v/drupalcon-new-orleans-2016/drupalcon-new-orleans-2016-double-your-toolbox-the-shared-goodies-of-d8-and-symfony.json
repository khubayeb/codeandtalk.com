These include routes and controllers, events and the all-important service, service container and (queue dramatic sound-effect) dependency injection. If these concepts are still fairly new to you, this talk is for you: master them all at once and unlock a world where one skillset will empower you to use D8 or the Symfony framework should that need arise. It's a wonderful, new shared world: let's make something amazing, together.", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-double-your-toolbox-the-shared-goodies-of-d8-and-symfony", "length": "51:53", "likes": "4", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "You already know that Symfony and Drupal share a lot of things, but you might not know what that means... or how dangerous it's ", "speaker_twitters": " @weaverryan", "speakers": {"ryan-weaver": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Grand Rapids, MI, USA", "github": "weaverryan", "home": "http://knpuniversity.com/", "name": "Ryan Weaver", "twitter": "weaverryan"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-behat-behavior-driven-development-functional-tests", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nnbpE7s-9J4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Behat: Behavior-Driven Development, Functional Tests"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-double-your-toolbox-the-shared-goodies-of-d8-and-symfony", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mrpn6GR3yV8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Double your toolbox: the shared goodies of D8 and Symfony"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mrpn6GR3yV8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Double your toolbox: the shared goodies of D8 and Symfony", "tweet_video": "Double%20your%20toolbox%3A%20the%20shared%20goodies%20of%20D8%20and%20Symfony%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016/drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-double-your-toolbox-the-shared-goodies-of-d8-and-symfony%20presented%20%40drupalconNA%20by%20%40weaverryan", "videos": [{"code": "Mrpn6GR3yV8", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "295"}
