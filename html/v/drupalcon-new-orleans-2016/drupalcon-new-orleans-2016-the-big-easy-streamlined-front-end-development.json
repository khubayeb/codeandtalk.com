Using the Pattern Lab starterkit for Twig (https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-php-twig-standard), we can create patterns that map to Drupal\u2019s Twig templates. Atoms are fields, molecules are view modes, organisms are views themselves! Eureka!!\n\nQuestions that may be teeming in your brain:\n\nHow do I install Pattern Lab?\nWhat sort of pattern directory structure is required to match Drupal\u2019s?\nAre there naming conventions that facilitate the process?\nHow can I affect the Drupal markup (custom classes) to match my pattern markup?\nRelax, it\u2019s not voodoo magic. We\u2019ll answer these questions and more.\n\nIn our session, we will: \n\nShow you how to install Pattern Lab\nLet Pattern Lab share your theme's CSS\nCreate some patterns based on a PSD  mockup and theme them\nBuild out the mockup in Drupal\nAdd the custom (using BEM/SMACSS of course!) classes we used in creating our patterns via the Drupal UI\nPreview our completed site!\n\n\nThe strength in this approach is threefold:\n\nAll the markup is belong to us: once again we can write the markup as we want it; no more divitis!\nTwo birds, one stone: the Pattern Lab version is visually identical to the Drupal version, and therefore can be used for client approval prior to site development\nTheme it once and done: minimal or no \"negotiating\" Pattern Lab's markup with Drupal's\nThis session will be fast paced and fun, and we guarantee you'll leave with a new sense of what's possible in Drupal 8 front-end development and beyond!", "event": {"name": "DrupalCon New Orleans 2016", "nickname": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016", "twitter": "drupalconNA", "url": "https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "drupalcon-new-orleans-2016-the-big-easy-streamlined-front-end-development", "length": "56:08", "likes": "4", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Pattern Lab and Twig, the perfect duo to streamline your front-end development process.
