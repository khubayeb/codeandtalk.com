{"description": "Sympathy for Data is a visual dataflow programming platform for data analysis written in Python. It was initially developed within an enterprise environment and is now released as free software/open source.\n\nWe will describe how and why the software was sold in to management and company lawyers to allow us to avoid proprietary lock-in of the software.\n\nThere are several competing products in the market aimed at business intelligence (BI) but we did not find that any of these were suitable for scientific engineering problems. BI-tools usually work with SQL-databases and tabular data which is a serious limitation. The technical choices behind the design of Sympathy for Data are to be motivated.\n\nSympathy for Data is currently powering a couple of demanding applications for data processing, modelling and prediction within an enterprise context. We are going to talk about these applications and show a short demonstration of the platform in action.\n\nDownload video: https://fscons.org/videos", "event": {"name": "FSCONS 2014", "nickname": "fscons-2014", "twitter": "fscons", "url": "https://fscons.org/2014/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "stefan-larsson-sympathy-for-data-fscons-2014", "length": "46:23", "likes": "3", "recorded": "2014-10-31", "short_description": "Sympathy for Data is a visual dataflow programming platform for data analysis written in Python.
