{"description": "Rubygems.org provides every Rubyist with an amazing service: all the libraries in the Ruby world. As amazing as that is, installing gems can be a time-consuming and even error-prone process. (Just ask the Travis guys.) In this talk, you'll learn about the recent dramatic changes in Rubygems and Bundler to improve speed and reliability by rewriting the Rubygems client/server architecture. I'll show how the new system caches more information, makes fewer requests, and takes less time to install gems. Finally, I'll cover how the changes allow worldwide mirrors of rubygems.org, improving things for Rubyists around the globe.\n\nShot by Just Shoot Me Digital - http://www.jsmdigital.co.za/\nMusic is Coma's U Dub by Nokom electro - http://www.jamendo.com/en/track/39238/coma-s-u-dub", "event": {"name": "Rubyfuza 2014", "nickname": "rubyfuza-2014", "twitter": "rubyfuza", "url": "http://www.rubyfuza.org/2014.html"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "extreme-makeover-rubygems-edition-andre-arko", "length": "36:53", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2014-02-06", "short_description": "Rubygems.org provides every Rubyist with an amazing service: all the libraries in the Ruby world.
