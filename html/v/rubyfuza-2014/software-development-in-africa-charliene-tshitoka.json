{"description": "Software development has gone through many upheavals and downhills to what it is currently. Still, it remains an impressive creation that is changing the lifestyles of many. Africa, on the other side, has a history that is yet to fully captivate many of its own people. So what could \"software development\" and \"Africa\" be doing in the same phrase?\n\nBeing passionate about code and enjoying a love-hate relationship with my continent, I will share how these words resonate with me.

Let's have a conversation on what these words mean for us; software development and Africa put together.\n\nShot by Just Shoot Me Digital - http://www.jsmdigital.co.za/\nMusic is Coma's U Dub by Nokom electro - http://www.jamendo.com/en/track/39238/coma-s-u-dub", "event": {"name": "Rubyfuza 2014", "nickname": "rubyfuza-2014", "twitter": "rubyfuza", "url": "http://www.rubyfuza.org/2014.html"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "software-development-in-africa-charliene-tshitoka", "length": "53:31", "likes": "2", "recorded": "2014-02-06", "short_description": "Software development has gone through many upheavals and downhills to what it is currently.
