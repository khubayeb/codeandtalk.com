{"description": "Software is made of bugs, yet software is controlling a growing part of our physical world. As bugs and security holes become potentially life-threatening, what can we do to make our software worthy of the trust we're placing in it?\n\nTake quadcopters, for example. Toy vehicles are not just in specialty hobby shops but even in supermarkets; sports stadiums and the White House are trying to find ways to keep them out; and everyone from agriculture startups to Amazon wants to use them commercially. Quadcopters are becoming safety and security critical systems, but how are we going to make them truly safe and secure?\n\nI'll present SMACCMPilot, a BSD-licensed high-assurance quadcopter autopilot, and the new tools and technologies that make it feasible to trust a large piece of software.", "event": {"name": "Open Source Bridge 2016", "nickname": "opensourcebridge-2015", "twitter": "osbridge", "url": "http://opensourcebridge.org/y2015/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "osb-2015-trustworthy-software-in-the-real-world-jamey-sharp", "length": "39:00", "likes": "2", "recorded": "2015-06-23", "short_description": "Software is made of bugs, yet software is controlling a growing part of our physical world.
