{"description": "DNA testing has become the \"gold standard\" of forensics, but linking an item of evidence to a person of interest isn't always clear cut. New open source tools allow DNA analysts to give statistical weight to evidentiary profiles that were previously unusable, letting juries weigh the evidence for themselves. This talk will discuss my lab's validation and implementation of the Lab Retriever software package for probabilistic genotyping.", "event": {"name": "Open Source Bridge 2016", "nickname": "opensourcebridge-2015", "twitter": "osbridge", "url": "http://opensourcebridge.org/y2015/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "osb-2015-calculating-guilt-using-open-source-software-in-forensic-dna-testing", "length": "41:22", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2015-06-23", "short_description": "DNA testing has become the gold standard of forensics, but linking an item of evidence to a person of interest isn't always clea", "speaker_twitters": " @sarahquaint", "speakers": {"sarah-chenoweth": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Baltimore, MD, USA", "home": "http://sarah.dreamwidth.org/", "name": "Sarah Chenoweth", "twitter": "sarahquaint"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Open Source Bridge 2016", "nickname": "opensourcebridge-2015", "twitter": "osbridge", "url": "http://opensourcebridge.org/y2015/"}, "filename": "osb-2015-calculating-guilt-using-open-source-software-in-forensic-dna-testing", "recorded": "2015-06-23", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vOFbPWHhVnM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Calculating Guilt: Using open-source software in forensic DNA testing"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vOFbPWHhVnM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Calculating Guilt: Using open-source software in forensic DNA testing", "tweet_video": "Calculating%20Guilt%3A%20Using%20open-source%20software%20in%20forensic%20DNA%20testing%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/opensourcebridge-2015/osb-2015-calculating-guilt-using-open-source-software-in-forensic-dna-testing%20presented%20%40osbridge%20by%20%40sarahquaint", "videos": [{"code": "vOFbPWHhVnM", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "41"}
