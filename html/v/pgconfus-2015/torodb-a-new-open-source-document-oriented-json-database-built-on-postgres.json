Concurrency, durability, journaling... all those are quite tough goals to achieve. Aren't RDBMs good enough?\n\nWe think they are, specially PostgreSQL. So we built ToroDB, a new \u201cNoSQL\u201d database, that speaks JSON, and uses PostgreSQL as the \u201cstorage layer\u201d. ToroDB doesn't use PostgreSQL's fantastic jsonb type; it instead offers a novel approach storing data relationally. JSON documents are split into parts, each of which is stored in a relation (table). This has several advantages, which will be outlined during the course of the talk.\n\nToroDB implements the MongoDB protocol, and is thus compatible with MongoDB applications. This means it supports the advanced MongoDB query language, and MongoDB language updates. And it's all open source and running on top of PostgreSQL :)\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\u00c1lvaro is a 35 year-old IT entrepreneur, founder of a couple of software tech companies (Wizzbill and 8Kdata).
