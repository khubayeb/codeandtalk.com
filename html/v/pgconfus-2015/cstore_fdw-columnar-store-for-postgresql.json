The extension follows the same data layout as Facebook's Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) format, and brings the following benefits:\n\n* Compression: Reduces the on-disk data size by 2-4x\n* Column Projections: Only read column data relevant to query, improves the performance for I/O bound queries\n* Skip Indexes: Keeps min/max statistics for row groups and uses them to skip over unrelated rows.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nOzgun is a co-founder and the CTO at Citus Data.
