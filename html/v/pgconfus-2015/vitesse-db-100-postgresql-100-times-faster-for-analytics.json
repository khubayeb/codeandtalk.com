{"description": "Check out http://www.pgconf.us/2015/event/112/ for the full talk details.\n\nVitesse DB is PostgreSQL for data warehouse. Rapid advances in memory, SSD, and core-count have produced affordable, powerful computers that comfortably fit the working sets of most DW queries on a single machine without resorting to MPP. Unfortunately, processing speed and single-threaded limitations have precluded PostgreSQL from DW applications. \n\nIn this talk, we will describe how we made TPCH Q1 run more than 100X faster on a Postgres instance. In particular, how we dramatically increase per-core efficiency of the Executor using LLVM for dynamic query compilation, and how we thread and scale query execution across many cores efficiently, yet still maintain 100% compatibility with PostgreSQL.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nI am Founder at Vitesse Data. Prior to that, I worked at Elance-oDesk as Director of Data Services, and at Greenplum as Sr. Architect. Experienced in data systems, and in particular, MPP data warehouse systems dating back to Informix XPS.", "event": {"name": "PGConf US 2015", "nickname": "pgconfus-2015", "twitter": "pgconfus", "url": "http://www.pgconf.us/2015/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "vitesse-db-100-postgresql-100-times-faster-for-analytics", "length": "29:17", "likes": "2", "recorded": "2015-03-25", "short_description": "Check out http://www.pgconf.us/2015/event/112/ for the full talk details.
