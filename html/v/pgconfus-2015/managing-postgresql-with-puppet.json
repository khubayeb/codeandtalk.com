{"description": "Check out http://www.pgconf.us/2015/event/56/ for the full talk details.\n\nPuppet has quickly become a popular tool for management of infrastructure. The Puppet Labs team provides an official puppet module for managing PostgreSQL installations. This excellent module provides documentation for patterns that are very straight forward for simple implementations. However, for service-oriented architecture where many applications share a database and disparate environments are prolific, PostgreSQL management becomes more complex.\n\nThis talk will review the use cases of the Puppet Labs module and how it can be leveraged to build complex application and database environments. Using an overview of the Puppet Lab's module, we'll review how CoverMyMeds implemented additional automation for things like master/slave awareness, database, role and grant management and environment-specific configuration.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nChris Everest is currently a Systems Operations Engineer at CoverMyMeds, Inc.
