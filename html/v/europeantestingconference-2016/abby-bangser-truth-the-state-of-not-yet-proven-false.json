{"description": "For all the things that the human mind can do, filling in gaps of information is one of the most interesting.\n\nWe have seen studies on this in many different areas of work. Statisticians, lawyers and scientists have identified that confirmation bias and the principles of inference are two ways we already know that our brain takes short cuts. As a team member, and even more as a tester, it is important to accept and deal with these short comings.\n\nIn this talk, Abby will look at the many places in our day to day team interactions where our biases paired with our desire to be proven correct impact the quality of our testing. Something as innocent as assuming the level of quality in work done before testing or verifying \u201chappy path\u201d first can wildly impact the end result. While there is no way to completely remove bias and inference from our lives, we can make them more deliberate in an effort to be even more impactful testers. You will leave this session with ideas for how you can begin on the road to awareness.\n\n(PS\u2026try counting the number of times the letter f is used in the first sentence. It may reveal your own brain\u2019s inferences!)\n\n\nCheck more at http://europeantestingconference.eu\nAll the videos from 2016 are at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF5ERStlaHg&list=PL_9ioxG4tU7sz_BwjPjHeLWr2CIoFNT10", "event": {"name": "European Testing Conference 2016", "nickname": "europeantestingconference-2016", "twitter": "EuroTestingConf", "url": "http://europeantestingconference.eu/2016/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2017-01-08", "filename": "abby-bangser-truth-the-state-of-not-yet-proven-false", "length": "30:13", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-02-11", "short_description": "For all the things that the human mind can do, filling in gaps of information is one of the most interesting.
