Or they are selling you something.</q></li>\n  <li>Patterns are for naming things that you see.</li>\n  <li><q>Best Practices are for beginners. Patterns for advanced people.</q></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Spike and Stabilize</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>A Spike is an experiment - timeboxed; it will be thrown away</li>\n  <li><q>A Spike is like an \"option\" in the financial world. It gives us a right, but not an obligation.</q></li>\n  <li><q>Test Driven Testing</q></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Hair Trigger</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>The Ability of a team to deploy its own code</li>\n  <li>This means the team can go quickly and it can also screw up quickly.</li>\n  <li>If there is a requirement for multiple people to review the code that settles some of the legal issues this might create.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Ginger Cake</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><q>Ginger Cake: Like chocolate cake just with ginger.</q></li>\n  <li><q>Copy-paste code to get start quickly.

No, there is spectrum.</q></li>\n  <li><q>Small sub-teams with common stand-ups</q></li>\n  <li></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Burn the Ships</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><q>Burn the Ships: Force your people to move forward by eliminating the way back.</q></li>\n  <li>Set specific goals with specific dead-lines.</li>\n</ul>\n\nFor a paradigm shift (e.g. moving to agile) you need 3 things:\n<ul>\n  <li>dead-line</li>\n  <li>no other options (can't back out)</li>\n  <li>information</li>\n</ul>\n\n<a href=\"https://leanpub.com/softwarefaster\">Software, Faster - the book</a>\n", "event": {"name": "GOTO Amsterdam 2016", "nickname": "gotocon-amsterdam-2016", "twitter": "GOTOamst", "url": "https://gotocon.com/amsterdam-2016/"}, "favorite": "0", "featured": "2017-01-05", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "goto-2016-software-faster-dan-north", "length": "54:20", "likes": "194", "recorded": "2016-06-14", "short_description": "Dan North - Agile Troublemaker, Developer, Originator of BDD Some teams are orders of magnitude more effective than others.
