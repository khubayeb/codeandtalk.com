{"description": "Today\u2019s development environment is heavily focussed on \u201cmobile first\u201d, but the long-term transition to this framework has been a challenging one. From mobile technology\u2019s first forays into web connectivity, user-friendliness, and market shaping, Japanese mobile culture has without a doubt had a lasting influence on how we make our development and design decisions.\n\nThis talk traces the advent of the mobile first paradigm from its roots in the Japanese mobile revolution, through to the power within the country\u2019s changing topography of market end-users, and some of the current issues that face mobile development and design in both Japan and the West. How did Japan\u2019s early mobile connectivity set the pace and priorities for not only burgeoning technology, but also the incipient business models that would grow to dominate our tech culture? Has the advent of smartphones really evened the playing field?\n\nThrough the lens of cultural psychology, technological history, and market analytics we\u2019ll take a closer look at how and why our mobile web is inextricably linked to Japan.\n\nhttp://rejectjs.org - http://twitter.com/rejectjs\nMusic by: https://soundcloud.com/7digits\nVideo by: http://wecap.de", "event": {"name": "RejectJS 2015", "nickname": "rejectjs-2015", "twitter": "", "url": "http://rejectjs.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "jennifer-geacone-cruz-perfectly-portable-japanese-mobile-culture-influencing-the-front-end", "length": "34:06", "likes": 0, "recorded": "2015-09-24", "short_description": "Today\u2019s development environment is heavily focussed on \u201cmobile first\u201d, but the long-term transition to this framework has been a", "speaker_twitters": " @anomiseditrix", "speakers": {"jennifer-geacone-cruz": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Berlin, Germany", "github": "anomiseditrix", "home": "http://www.geaconecruz.net/", "name": "Jennifer Geacone-Cruz", "twitter": "anomiseditrix"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "RejectJS 2015", "nickname": "rejectjs-2015", "twitter": "", "url": "http://rejectjs.org/"}, "filename": "jennifer-geacone-cruz-perfectly-portable-japanese-mobile-culture-influencing-the-front-end", "recorded": "2015-09-24", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fuxJmw2shnU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Perfectly Portable \u2013 Japanese Mobile Culture Influencing the Front-End"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fuxJmw2shnU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Perfectly Portable \u2013 Japanese Mobile Culture Influencing the Front-End", "tweet_video": "Perfectly%20Portable%20%E2%80%93%20Japanese%20Mobile%20Culture%20Influencing%20the%20Front-End%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/rejectjs-2015/jennifer-geacone-cruz-perfectly-portable-japanese-mobile-culture-influencing-the-front-end%20by%20%40anomiseditrix", "videos": [{"code": "fuxJmw2shnU", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "1010"}
