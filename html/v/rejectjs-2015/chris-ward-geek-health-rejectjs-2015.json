{"description": "We keep up to date with the latest developments in technologies and tools. We make sure to post pull requests to fix bugs we found in projects. We offer helpful advice in forums to people with coding questions. We propose talks for meetups and conferences to provide insight and inspiration.\n\nAll this on top of our day job.\n\nWhen in the midst of all this activity do we stop to think about our mental or physical health?\n\nThe mental stress of sustained periods of high intellectual activity is draining and exhausting. The Physical impact of having such a sedentary job is becoming increasingly recognised. And all those caffeinated and sugar filled drinks we consume to keep going? Yeah, they\u2019re not that good for us either.\n\nIn this presentation I will look at quick tips to keep ourselves a little healthier whilst we do what we love. I\u2019m not talking gruelling evenings huffing and puffing at the gym, but manageable and easy advice to whip you into shape.\n\nhttp://rejectjs.org - http://twitter.com/rejectjs\nMusic by: https://soundcloud.com/7digits\nVideo by: http://wecap.de", "event": {"name": "RejectJS 2015", "nickname": "rejectjs-2015", "twitter": "", "url": "http://rejectjs.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "chris-ward-geek-health-rejectjs-2015", "length": "27:01", "likes": 0, "recorded": "2015-09-24", "short_description": "We keep up to date with the latest developments in technologies and tools.
