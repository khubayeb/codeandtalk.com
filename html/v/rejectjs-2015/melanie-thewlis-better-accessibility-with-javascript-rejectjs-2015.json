{"description": "Making the web accessible to people with all abilities is a key social justice issue of our era. Unfortunately, there\u2019s still a lack of commonly adopted best practices. For developers, it can feel like a daunting challenge to sort through all the relevant technical documentation and work out how to apply it.\n\nThis talk aims to address this problem by presenting some practical and easy to apply code samples that can significantly improve the web experience for people with a range of disabilities. It will also demonstrate how common Javascript libraries can be built upon to allow assistive technologies to access features of rich web applications such as maps, filtering and carousels.\n\nAs well as looking at the code, there will be a short introduction to the legislative framework, technical specifications, project management and testing approaches for developing accessible websites.\n\nhttp://rejectjs.org - http://twitter.com/rejectjs\nMusic by: https://soundcloud.com/7digits\nVideo by: http://wecap.de", "event": {"name": "RejectJS 2015", "nickname": "rejectjs-2015", "twitter": "", "url": "http://rejectjs.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "melanie-thewlis-better-accessibility-with-javascript-rejectjs-2015", "length": "31:41", "likes": 0, "recorded": "2015-09-24", "short_description": "Making the web accessible to people with all abilities is a key social justice issue of our era.
