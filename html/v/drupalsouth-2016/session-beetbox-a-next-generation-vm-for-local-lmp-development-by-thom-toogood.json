(Simple host setup)\n* Modular architecture (core & contrib/ansible galaxy roles)\n* Pets v cattle (Don't fix rebuild!)\n* Almost limitless extensibility (Ansible custom tasks)\n* Not Drupal specific (supports any L*MP project - Symfony, Wordpress etc)\n* Latest development tools\n    - drush/drupal console\n    - composer\n    - xdebug\n    - xhprof/blackfire\n    - memcached/redis\n    - mailhog\n    - varnish\n    - phantomjs/selenium\n    - solr/elasticsearch\n    - ruby/nodejs\n    - docker/lxd\n    - & more\n\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/session/beetbox-next-generation-vm-local-lmp-development", "event": {"name": "DrupalSouth 2016", "nickname": "drupalsouth-2016", "twitter": "drupalsouth", "url": "https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "session-beetbox-a-next-generation-vm-for-local-lmp-development-by-thom-toogood", "length": "44:06", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-10-26", "short_description": "DrupalSouth Gold Coast 2016 https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/ Room: Doghouse Agency (Level 2) Thu, 27-Oct, 11:30 Intermediate", "speaker_twitters": " @thomtoogood", "speakers": {"thom-toogood": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Melbourne, Australia", "github": "thom8", "home": "https://about.me/thomtoogood", "name": "Thom Toogood", "twitter": "thomtoogood"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalSouth 2016", "nickname": "drupalsouth-2016", "twitter": "drupalsouth", "url": "https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/"}, "filename": "session-beetbox-a-next-generation-vm-for-local-lmp-development-by-thom-toogood", "recorded": "2016-10-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ff7dEadrY18/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Beetbox - a next generation VM for local L*MP development"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ff7dEadrY18/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Beetbox - a next generation VM for local L*MP development", "tweet_video": "Beetbox%20-%20a%20next%20generation%20VM%20for%20local%20L%2AMP%20development%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalsouth-2016/session-beetbox-a-next-generation-vm-for-local-lmp-development-by-thom-toogood%20presented%20%40drupalsouth%20by%20%40thomtoogood", "videos": [{"code": "Ff7dEadrY18", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "55"}
