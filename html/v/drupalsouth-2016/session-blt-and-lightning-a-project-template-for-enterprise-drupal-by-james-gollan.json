{"description": "DrupalSouth Gold Coast 2016\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/\n\nBLT and Lightning - A project template for enterprise Drupal\nRoom: Doghouse Agency (Level 2)\nFri, 28-Oct, 13:15\nIntermediate - Building\nJames Gollan\n\nBLT is an open-source project that has evolved within Acquia for standardising the build and management of Drupal projects. It has recently been released as an open-source project. Lightning is a Drupal 8 distribution designed to provide a starting point for Drupal 8 projects.\n\nThese projects form the starting point for most Acquia Professional Services projects. During this session we will cover:\n\n- the problem are these projects solving;\n- the benefits and drawbacks of using them;\n- how to start a project using BLT;\n- how to integrate a CI solution with your BLT project.\n\nThe concepts covered should be relevant to anyone kicking off a project in Drupal. Some of the code concepts will require a degree of development experience.\n\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/session/blt-and-lightning-project-template-enterprise-drupal", "event": {"name": "DrupalSouth 2016", "nickname": "drupalsouth-2016", "twitter": "drupalsouth", "url": "https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "session-blt-and-lightning-a-project-template-for-enterprise-drupal-by-james-gollan", "length": "46:41", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-10-26", "short_description": "DrupalSouth Gold Coast 2016 https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/ BLT and Lightning - A project template for enterprise Drupal Ro", "speaker_twitters": " @gollyg", "speakers": {"james-gollan": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Sydney, Australia", "github": "gollyg", "name": "James Gollan", "twitter": "gollyg"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalSouth 2015", "nickname": "drupalsouth-2015", "twitter": "drupalsouth", "url": "https://melbourne2015.drupal.org.au/"}, "filename": "scald-media-management-a-new-hope-by-james-gollan", "recorded": "2015-03-05", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x4I9TmBt1C8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Scald media management"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalSouth 2016", "nickname": "drupalsouth-2016", "twitter": "drupalsouth", "url": "https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/"}, "filename": "session-blt-and-lightning-a-project-template-for-enterprise-drupal-by-james-gollan", "recorded": "2016-10-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cDB7uqOVJl4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "BLT and Lightning - A project template for enterprise Drupal"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cDB7uqOVJl4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "BLT and Lightning - A project template for enterprise Drupal", "tweet_video": "BLT%20and%20Lightning%20-%20A%20project%20template%20for%20enterprise%20Drupal%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalsouth-2016/session-blt-and-lightning-a-project-template-for-enterprise-drupal-by-james-gollan%20presented%20%40drupalsouth%20by%20%40gollyg", "videos": [{"code": "cDB7uqOVJl4", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "114"}
