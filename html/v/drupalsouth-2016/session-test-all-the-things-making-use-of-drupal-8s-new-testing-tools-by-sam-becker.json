{"description": "Test all the things! Making use of Drupal 8's new testing tools\nRoom: RealityLoop (Level 2)\nThu, 27-Oct, 14:15\nBeginner - Building\nSam Becker\n\n\nWith Drupal 8 released, one of the most important aspects of building a website or module has changed dramatically for the better. Developers now have a myriad of tools at their disposal to be able to test their code. If you are interested in improving your code and preventing bugs, but are unfamiliar with acronyms like BTB, KTB and WTB, this session is for you. If you\u2019ve dabbled in testing but haven\u2019t explored the depths of PHPUnit or Mink, then this session is for you.\n\nIn this session, participants will learn:\n\n- Testing fundamentals, what types of tests you might write for different situations.\n- A look at real world examples of test cases from Drupal 8 contrib.\n- Knowledge about tools that strictly exist within Drupal core, ready for use out of the box.\n- How to execute and run tests locally and on the Drupal testbot.\n\nAs a community, modern testing tools give us the opportunity to make Drupal 8 core and contrib the most stable, feature rich version of Drupal yet.\n\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/session/test-all-things-making-use-drupal-8s-new-testing-tools", "event": {"name": "DrupalSouth 2016", "nickname": "drupalsouth-2016", "twitter": "drupalsouth", "url": "https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "session-test-all-the-things-making-use-of-drupal-8s-new-testing-tools-by-sam-becker", "length": "41:04", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-10-26", "short_description": "Test all the things!
