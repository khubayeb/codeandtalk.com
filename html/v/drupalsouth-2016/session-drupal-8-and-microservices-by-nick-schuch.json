During Drupal 8's development lifecycle we have seen many examples of how Drupal can be decoupled from the frontend, but very little on the backend.\n\nCome with me on a journey, as we answer the question \"Is Drupal 8 ready for microservices?\" and build a small prototype to demonstrate.\n\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/session/drupal-8-and-microservices", "event": {"name": "DrupalSouth 2016", "nickname": "drupalsouth-2016", "twitter": "drupalsouth", "url": "https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "session-drupal-8-and-microservices-by-nick-schuch", "length": "31:25", "likes": "2", "recorded": "2016-10-26", "short_description": "DrupalSouth Gold Coast 2016 https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/ Drupal 8 and Microservices Room: Doghouse Agency (Level 2) Inte", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {"nick-schuch": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Australia", "name": "Nick Schuch"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalSouth 2015", "nickname": "drupalsouth-2015", "twitter": "drupalsouth", "url": "https://melbourne2015.drupal.org.au/"}, "filename": "the-drupalci-initiative-by-nick-schuch", "recorded": "2015-03-05", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aRuCzW23QRc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The DrupalCI initiative"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalSouth 2016", "nickname": "drupalsouth-2016", "twitter": "drupalsouth", "url": "https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/"}, "filename": "session-drupal-8-and-microservices-by-nick-schuch", "recorded": "2016-10-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mf1aq79sx1I/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Drupal 8 and Microservices"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mf1aq79sx1I/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Drupal 8 and Microservices", "tweet_video": "Drupal%208%20and%20Microservices%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalsouth-2016/session-drupal-8-and-microservices-by-nick-schuch%20presented%20%40drupalsouth", "videos": [{"code": "mf1aq79sx1I", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "70"}
