Marketing personas, design personas, buyer personas, and all the other interpretations out there make it a bit confusion what we're talking about. This talk aims to give an insight into design personas in terms of how they're used in UX design process. I explore how a persona is constructed, why it represents an artefact of your in person research, what they're used for and some common mistakes people make with them.  You can view the slides that I already have here - slides.com/ameliaschmidt/personas - happy to alter/update them for this iteration of the talk. This is a talk I have presented at Be Reponsive and Ladies that UX, and have extended to a three hour workshop for General Assembly.\n\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/session/personas-what-are-they-good", "event": {"name": "DrupalSouth 2016", "nickname": "drupalsouth-2016", "twitter": "drupalsouth", "url": "https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "session-personas-what-are-they-good-for-by-amelia-schmidt", "length": "40:24", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-10-26", "short_description": "DrupalSouth Gold Coast 2016 https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/ Personas - what are they good for?
