{"description": "DrupalSouth Gold Coast 2016\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/\n\nDrupal 8 on a really small Web server\nRoom: Realityloop (Level 2)\nIntermediate - Inventing\nPeter Moulding\n\nDrupal 8 works on the world's smallest practical Web server, a Raspberry Pi Zero using all the LAMP/LNMP software you use on regular Web sites. You can build completely dynamic information signs and booths.\n\nPlus the Raspberry Pi has analogue and digital device connections for reading or controlling anything. Imagine a green information display showing the real temperature/humidity/sunlight at the display location. Add automated sun shades, fans, and other technology. Control everything from the Raspberry Pi. Add buttons and sliders to your Drupal Web site to control the devices through the Raspberry Pi.\n\nThe session includes:\n- Configuring a Raspberry Pi for development\n- Configuring a Raspberry Pi Zero for end use\n- Locking down the OS\n- Remote access for administration\n- Remote access for content updates\n- An introduction to the easiest analogue and digital hardware interfacing\n\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/session/drupal-8-really-small-web-server", "event": {"name": "DrupalSouth 2016", "nickname": "drupalsouth-2016", "twitter": "drupalsouth", "url": "https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "session-drupal-8-on-a-really-small-web-server-by-peter-moulding", "length": "29:23", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-10-26", "short_description": "DrupalSouth Gold Coast 2016 https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/ Drupal 8 on a really small Web server Room: Realityloop (Level ", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {"peter-moulding": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"home": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/petermoulding", "name": "Peter Moulding"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalSouth 2015", "nickname": "drupalsouth-2015", "twitter": "drupalsouth", "url": "https://melbourne2015.drupal.org.au/"}, "filename": "the-future-of-speed-by-peter-moulding", "recorded": "2015-03-05", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/215BnOoCkd0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The future of Speed"}, {"event": {"name": "DrupalSouth 2016", "nickname": "drupalsouth-2016", "twitter": "drupalsouth", "url": "https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/"}, "filename": "session-drupal-8-on-a-really-small-web-server-by-peter-moulding", "recorded": "2016-10-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_ZmY5rDdYHM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Drupal 8 on a really small Web server"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_ZmY5rDdYHM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Drupal 8 on a really small Web server", "tweet_video": "Drupal%208%20on%20a%20really%20small%20Web%20server%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalsouth-2016/session-drupal-8-on-a-really-small-web-server-by-peter-moulding%20presented%20%40drupalsouth", "videos": [{"code": "_ZmY5rDdYHM", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "31"}
