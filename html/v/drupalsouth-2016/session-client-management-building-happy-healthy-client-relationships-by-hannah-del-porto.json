{"description": "DrupalSouth Gold Coast 2016\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/\n\nRoom: Acquia (Level 2)\nThu, 27-Oct, 11:30\nBeginner - Planning\nHannah Del Porto\n\nOver more than 15 years at a web development firm, I have made pretty much every client management mistake possible. Forgetting to formalize the timeline until halfway through the build? Been there. Excitedly executing a contract without nailing down scope? Done that. Pitching a feature that a client didn't really need or that our team can\u2019t really execute? More than once. But a few years ago, we decided to think seriously about the other side of the table. How could we make sure that clients were happy with our services, while still being fair to our employees and our firm?\n\nWe realized that pretty much all of our problems with clients came down to communication. So through trial and error, we've developed some rules and tools for making sure that we are on the same page as our clients throughout the project. These tactics are as applicable to those working as part of an internal team - with a boss or a board as the end client - as they are to a development agency.\n\nThe session will focus on:\n- Identifying and managing client fears\n- Educating clients on the development process and the value of developers\n- Setting expectations with clear and timely communication\n- Defining project scope, deliverables and two-sided timelines\n- Managing conflict\n- Building long-term client partnerships\n\nAt the end of the session, attendees will have learned how to manage their projects more effectively, resulting in higher quality work, satisfied clients, improved profit margins and happier internal teams.\n\nhttps://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/session/client-management-building-happy-healthy-client-relationships", "event": {"name": "DrupalSouth 2016", "nickname": "drupalsouth-2016", "twitter": "drupalsouth", "url": "https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "session-client-management-building-happy-healthy-client-relationships-by-hannah-del-porto", "length": "44:01", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-10-26", "short_description": "DrupalSouth Gold Coast 2016 https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/ Room: Acquia (Level 2) Thu, 27-Oct, 11:30 Beginner - Planning H", "speaker_twitters": " @hcdelp", "speakers": {"hannah-del-porto": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Bangkok, Thailand", "home": "http://www.thebrickfactory.com/", "name": "Hannah Del Porto", "twitter": "hcdelp"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "DrupalSouth 2016", "nickname": "drupalsouth-2016", "twitter": "drupalsouth", "url": "https://goldcoast2016.drupal.org.au/"}, "filename": "session-client-management-building-happy-healthy-client-relationships-by-hannah-del-porto", "recorded": "2016-10-26", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YH_QWW7aJPA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Client Management: Building Happy, Healthy Client Relationships"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YH_QWW7aJPA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Client Management: Building Happy, Healthy Client Relationships", "tweet_video": "Client%20Management%3A%20Building%20Happy%2C%20Healthy%20Client%20Relationships%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/drupalsouth-2016/session-client-management-building-happy-healthy-client-relationships-by-hannah-del-porto%20presented%20%40drupalsouth%20by%20%40hcdelp", "videos": [{"code": "YH_QWW7aJPA", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "62"}
