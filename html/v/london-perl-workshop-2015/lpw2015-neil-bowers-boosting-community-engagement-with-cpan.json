{"description": "The CPAN Pull Request Challenge has been running since January of this year. Participants are assigned a different CPAN distribution each month, and have a month to submit at least one pull request.\n\nMy original goal was to get some bugs fixed and older distributions updated to follow recent CPAN conventions. But many more people signed up than I was expecting, and as a result some of the goals and my motivation changed.\n\nWhile retaining the original goals, it has become more about how to get people involved in \"the CPAN community\", and participants helping each other to improve how they develop, test and release their CPAN distributions.\n\nIn this talk I'll cover how the challenge evolved and give some stats showing the impact it's had on CPAN this year. I'll talk about why people signed up, and why they dropped out, and what both of those mean if we want to try and engage people, particularly beginners, in open source communities.", "event": {"name": "London Perl Workshop 2015", "nickname": "london-perl-workshop-2015", "twitter": "LondonPerl", "url": "http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2015/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "lpw2015-neil-bowers-boosting-community-engagement-with-cpan", "length": "26:13", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2015-12-12", "short_description": "The CPAN Pull Request Challenge has been running since January of this year.
