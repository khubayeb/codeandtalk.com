{"description": "Languages like Haskell and Idris don\u2019t have \u201cvariables\u201d in the same way that Perl does: once a name has been associated with a value, it has that same value immutably and forever. This approach is perhaps surprising, but it has some big advantages: it\u2019s much easier to reason about what your program\u2019s doing, especially for data that\u2019s being accessed from multiple processes.\n\nThis talk offers a case study of a piece of real-world Perl software that scrapes rich, detailed information from web pages published by the Scottish and UK parliaments, and presents it to commercial customers. The software is designed around this idea of never changing data once it\u2019s been assigned, and makes full use of that fact to promote highly concurrent operation. This turns out to be a fruitful approach to software design, even in a language like Perl, which has none of Haskell\u2019s features for working with immutable data.", "event": {"name": "London Perl Workshop 2015", "nickname": "london-perl-workshop-2015", "twitter": "LondonPerl", "url": "http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2015/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "lpw2015-aaron-crane-write-once-data-writing-perl-like-haskell", "length": "36:30", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2015-12-12", "short_description": "Languages like Haskell and Idris don\u2019t have \u201cvariables\u201d in the same way that Perl does: once a name has been associated with a v", "speaker_twitters": " @aaroncrane", "speakers": {"aaron-crane": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Edinburgh, UK", "github": "arc", "home": "http://aaroncrane.co.uk/", "name": "Aaron Crane", "twitter": "aaroncrane"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "London Perl Workshop 2015", "nickname": "london-perl-workshop-2015", "twitter": "LondonPerl", "url": "http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2015/"}, "filename": "lpw2015-aaron-crane-write-once-data-writing-perl-like-haskell", "recorded": "2015-12-12", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qcuTdy9uaM0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Write once data: writing Perl like Haskell"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qcuTdy9uaM0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Write once data: writing Perl like Haskell", "tweet_video": "Write%20once%20data%3A%20writing%20Perl%20like%20Haskell%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/london-perl-workshop-2015/lpw2015-aaron-crane-write-once-data-writing-perl-like-haskell%20presented%20%40LondonPerl%20by%20%40aaroncrane", "videos": [{"code": "qcuTdy9uaM0", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "44"}
