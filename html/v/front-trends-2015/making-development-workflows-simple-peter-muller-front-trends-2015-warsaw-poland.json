Getting into web development has never had a steeper learning curve and nobody seems to be addressing the fact that this might hurt our community in the long run by scaring newcomers.\n\nIn this talk, I will focus on precompilers and transpilers and the workflow and tooling around them. I want to bring us closer to a more comprehensible abstraction and a simpler API that will let the current and future generations of web developers focus on the work, rather than the tools.", "event": {"name": "Front-Trends 2015", "nickname": "front-trends-2015", "twitter": "fronttrends", "url": "https://2015.front-trends.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "making-development-workflows-simple-peter-muller-front-trends-2015-warsaw-poland", "length": "34:22", "likes": "18", "recorded": "2015-05-06", "short_description": "http://front-trends.com/ In a world of ever-increasing complexity in compilers, build systems, tests and tools that all have to ", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yBtQBvOv1z8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Making development workflows simple \u2013 Peter M\u00fcller / Front-Trends 2015, Warsaw, Poland", "tweet_video": "Making%20development%20workflows%20simple%20%E2%80%93%20Peter%20M%C3%BCller%20/%20Front-Trends%202015%2C%20Warsaw%2C%20Poland%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/front-trends-2015/making-development-workflows-simple-peter-muller-front-trends-2015-warsaw-poland%20presented%20%40fronttrends", "videos": [{"code": "yBtQBvOv1z8", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "1560"}
