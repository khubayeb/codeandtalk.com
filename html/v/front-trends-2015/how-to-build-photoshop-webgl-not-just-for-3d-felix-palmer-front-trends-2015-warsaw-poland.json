{"description": "http://front-trends.com\n\nWebGL is normally associated with 3D graphics, which can seem daunting without a background in this field. However, the WebGL API is inherently 2D, merely supplying a very useful toolbox of functionality for creating 3D engines.\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore how WebGL can be used to manipulate 2D graphics, by creating a simple image editing application. Through live-coding, we\u2019ll see that working with WebGL isn\u2019t all that complicated and can be achieved without having to reach for higher level frameworks, and how hardware accelerated image effects like color changes, deformations or blurs can be implemented in a few lines of code.\n\nSlides: http://felixpalmer.github.io/photo.gl/presentation?full#1", "event": {"name": "Front-Trends 2015", "nickname": "front-trends-2015", "twitter": "fronttrends", "url": "https://2015.front-trends.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "how-to-build-photoshop-webgl-not-just-for-3d-felix-palmer-front-trends-2015-warsaw-poland", "length": "35:12", "likes": "12", "recorded": "2015-05-06", "short_description": "http://front-trends.com WebGL is normally associated with 3D graphics, which can seem daunting without a background in this fiel", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x6fXhY17atI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "How to build Photoshop \u2013 WebGL not just for 3D \u2013 Felix Palmer / Front-Trends 2015, Warsaw, Poland", "tweet_video": "How%20to%20build%20Photoshop%20%E2%80%93%20WebGL%20not%20just%20for%203D%20%E2%80%93%20Felix%20Palmer%20/%20Front-Trends%202015%2C%20Warsaw%2C%20Poland%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/front-trends-2015/how-to-build-photoshop-webgl-not-just-for-3d-felix-palmer-front-trends-2015-warsaw-poland%20presented%20%40fronttrends", "videos": [{"code": "x6fXhY17atI", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "772"}
