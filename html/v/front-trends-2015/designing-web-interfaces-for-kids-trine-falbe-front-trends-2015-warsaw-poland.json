{"description": "http://front-trends.com/\n\nThrough my research with children, games and learning (all of which I\u2019ve worked with over a number of years) I have found that the way kids use interfaces differ a lot from adult interaction patterns. They have different search patterns, language skills, cognitive skills and motor skills. And this has a big impact on the way we should design interfaces when the users are children.\n\nThis subject is important, because kids these days use online tools from before they can read. They are growing up in a new paradigm \u2013 they have not known the world before the Internet. This impacts the way they act on, interact with, and perceive, the web.\n\nIn this talk, I will inform you about the way kids interact with interfaces, how it differs from the interaction patterns of adults, and provide you with some guidelines on how to design (non-game) web interfaces for kids.", "event": {"name": "Front-Trends 2015", "nickname": "front-trends-2015", "twitter": "fronttrends", "url": "https://2015.front-trends.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "designing-web-interfaces-for-kids-trine-falbe-front-trends-2015-warsaw-poland", "length": "40:34", "likes": "4", "recorded": "2015-05-06", "short_description": "http://front-trends.com/ Through my research with children, games and learning (all of which I\u2019ve worked with over a number of y", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t1hMdMV4ytQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Designing web interfaces for kids \u2013 Trine Falbe / Front-Trends 2015, Warsaw, Poland", "tweet_video": "Designing%20web%20interfaces%20for%20kids%20%E2%80%93%20Trine%20Falbe%20/%20Front-Trends%202015%2C%20Warsaw%2C%20Poland%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/front-trends-2015/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids-trine-falbe-front-trends-2015-warsaw-poland%20presented%20%40fronttrends", "videos": [{"code": "t1hMdMV4ytQ", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "517"}
