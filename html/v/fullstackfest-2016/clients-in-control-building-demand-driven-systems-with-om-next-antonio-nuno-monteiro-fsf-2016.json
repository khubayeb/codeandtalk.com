{"description": "Traditional architectures are no longer suitable for the increasing needs of today's applications. The price is often paid in high bandwidth and reduced performance. Demand-driven design enables clients to request arbitrary data on demand. Companies like Facebook and Netflix have switched to demand-driven architectures to better embrace a great variety of continuously changing clients. Solutions like Relay and Falcor/JSONGraph distill such ideas. Om Next builds on, and extends these concepts further, to provide a Clojure(Script) based solution. In this talk, I present the motivation for a demand-driven approach and explore the benefits and tradeoffs that Om Next brings to the table.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nAnt\u00f3nio is a software engineer currently living in Germany. He's fascinated by functional programming and Clojure in particular. He is a contributor to the Om project, and has lately been helping companies build new, demand-driven systems using Om Next.\n\nTalk given at Full Stack Fest 2016", "event": {"name": "Fullstack Fest 2016", "nickname": "fullstackfest-2016", "twitter": "fullstackfest", "url": "https://2016.fullstackfest.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "clients-in-control-building-demand-driven-systems-with-om-next-antonio-nuno-monteiro-fsf-2016", "length": "38:27", "likes": "12", "recorded": "2016-09-05", "short_description": "Traditional architectures are no longer suitable for the increasing needs of today's applications.
