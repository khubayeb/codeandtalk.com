{"description": "2016 has brought the launch of consumer-level desktop virtual reality technologies for the first time, and how we experience data and information is shifting into 3D. Today's web technologies are shaping the future of the VR web and bringing immersive experiences to support cross-platform, device-agnostic virtual reality experiences right in the browser. In this talk, we'll cover the experimental WebVR API and how new libraries and frameworks are developing to support immersive technologies that work on devices from Google Cardboard to the Oculus Rift, as well as how new virtual reality applications are using JavaScript and WebGL to enable user-generated content.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nLiv Erickson is a Virtual and Augmented Reality Developer Evangelist at Microsoft based out of the San Francisco Bay Area.
