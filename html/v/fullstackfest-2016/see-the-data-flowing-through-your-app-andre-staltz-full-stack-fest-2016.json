{"description": "What if instead of building your own mental model of how data flows through your application, you could actually see the data flowing in real-time? In this talk we will explore functional and reactive streams as a building block in JavaScript applications, with tools like RxJS, Cycle.js, xstream, which enable DevTools from the future.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nUser interface developer and designer, with extensive knowledge in reactive programming. Obsessed with the future - wants to make it become reality today.\n\nSoftware deals with complex control flow mechanisms like callbacks, promises, events, and streams. Chosen solution has a deep impact on your code. Things can be simplified to a single abstraction since the underlying problem to all of this is the same, with CSP and the concept of channels.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nVincenzo Chianese is an Italian software developer currently working for Apiary.io. He puts bugs in the code, making sure that his coworkers have always something to fix.\n\nTalk given at Full Stack Fest 2016 (https://www.fullstackfest.com)", "event": {"name": "Fullstack Fest 2016", "nickname": "fullstackfest-2016", "twitter": "fullstackfest", "url": "https://2016.fullstackfest.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "see-the-data-flowing-through-your-app-andre-staltz-full-stack-fest-2016", "length": "33:38", "likes": "129", "recorded": "2016-09-05", "short_description": "What if instead of building your own mental model of how data flows through your application, you could actually see the data fl", "speaker_twitters": " @andrestaltz", "speakers": {"andre-staltz-medeiros": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Helsinki, Finland", "github": "staltz", "home": "http://staltz.com/", "name": "Andr\u00e9 Staltz Medeiros", "twitter": "andrestaltz"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Fullstack Fest 2016", "nickname": "fullstackfest-2016", "twitter": "fullstackfest", "url": "https://2016.fullstackfest.com/"}, "filename": "see-the-data-flowing-through-your-app-andre-staltz-full-stack-fest-2016", "recorded": "2016-09-05", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R-GzJgEccEQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "See the data flowing through your app"}, {"event": {"name": "GOTO Copenhagen 2016", "nickname": "gotocon-copenhagen-2016", "twitter": "GOTOcph", "url": "https://gotocon.com/cph-2016/"}, "filename": "goto-2016-the-return-of-stream-io-andre-staltz-medeiros", "recorded": "2016-10-03", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tkjg179M-Nc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Return of Stream I/O"}, {"event": {"name": "ngEurope 2016", "nickname": "ng-europe-2016", "twitter": "ngEurope", "url": "https://ngeurope.org/"}, "filename": "andre-staltz-andrestaltz-you-will-learn-rxjs-at-ng-europe-2016", "recorded": "2016-10-25", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uQ1zhJHclvs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "You will learn RxJS"}, {"event": {"name": "PolyConf - Polyglot Programmers Unite - 2016", "nickname": "polyconf-2016", "twitter": "", "url": "http://polyconf.com/"}, "filename": "polyconf-16-dynamics-of-change-why-reactivity-matters-andre-staltz", "recorded": "2016-06-30", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v68ppDlvHqs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Dynamics of change: why reactivity matters"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R-GzJgEccEQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "See the data flowing through your app", "tweet_video": "See%20the%20data%20flowing%20through%20your%20app%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/fullstackfest-2016/see-the-data-flowing-through-your-app-andre-staltz-full-stack-fest-2016%20presented%20%40fullstackfest%20by%20%40andrestaltz", "videos": [{"code": "R-GzJgEccEQ", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "4620"}
