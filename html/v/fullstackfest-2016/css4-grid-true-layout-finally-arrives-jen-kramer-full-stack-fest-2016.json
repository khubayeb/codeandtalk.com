{"description": "For years, front-end developers fumbled with hacking floats for layouts, often as part of a grid system. Media queries made these float-based grids more responsive to different screen dimensions, but unfortunately, the behaviors weren't always granular enough to work well with complex layouts. Now with the new Grid specification in CSS4, we can easily define behaviors for each cell in our layouts in two dimensions. When combined with media queries, we can specify where each cell will be placed under a variety of conditions, in horizontal and vertical space. Similarities and differences with Flexbox will also be identified and discussed.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nJen Kramer has been teaching and performing web design for over 16 years.
