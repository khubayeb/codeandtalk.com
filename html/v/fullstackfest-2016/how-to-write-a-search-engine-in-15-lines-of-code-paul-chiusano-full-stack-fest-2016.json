{"description": "Unison is a new programming language and platform. This talk zooms in on just one aspect of Unison: its support for building large-scale, distributed systems. As a running example, Paul will work up to the code for a simple search engine, written with minimal code, and discuss how it's all done.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nFounder and Principal Consultant at Stage N Consulting, specializing in Scala, Haskell, Elm, and functional programming. Previously a technical lead at S&P Capital IQ, where he grew and led a team of Scala and Haskell developers successfully applying functional programming to a variety of problems. Open source contributor to the library 'FS2: Functional Streams for Scala', a library for the Scala language. Also co-author of the book Functional Programming in Scala.\n\nTalk given at Full Stack Fest 2016 (https://www.fullstackfest.com)", "event": {"name": "Fullstack Fest 2016", "nickname": "fullstackfest-2016", "twitter": "fullstackfest", "url": "https://2016.fullstackfest.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "how-to-write-a-search-engine-in-15-lines-of-code-paul-chiusano-full-stack-fest-2016", "length": "36:05", "likes": "21", "recorded": "2016-09-05", "short_description": "Unison is a new programming language and platform.
