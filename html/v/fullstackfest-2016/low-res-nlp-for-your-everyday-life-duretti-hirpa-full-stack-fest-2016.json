{"description": "NLP can be a scary piece of jargon. In reality, you can get a far distance with loops, functions, and if statements, and still manage to create a delightful chat interface. This talk will cover low-res ways to incorporate NLP so you can get more bang for your buck without needing full AI.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nDuretti Hirpa is a senior engineer on the backend engineering team at Slack. Currently, she's working on the growth team, though she's also spent time on the Slack Platform team - making it easier and more intuitive to build applications on top of Slack. She's constantly thinking of ways to humanize engineering - there's strength in the soft skills, after all. She's arguably probably the most extroverted person she knows, and is intensely interested in other people. She produces a podcast called \u201csnackoverflow\u201d, about snacks, computers, and their surprising intersection. She has an undying love for Beyonc\u00e9 (praise be), an immaculate gif game, and a real candy problem.\n\nTalk given at Full Stack Fest 2016 (https://www.fullstackfest.com)", "event": {"name": "Fullstack Fest 2016", "nickname": "fullstackfest-2016", "twitter": "fullstackfest", "url": "https://2016.fullstackfest.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "low-res-nlp-for-your-everyday-life-duretti-hirpa-full-stack-fest-2016", "length": "24:04", "likes": "4", "recorded": "2016-09-05", "short_description": "NLP can be a scary piece of jargon.
