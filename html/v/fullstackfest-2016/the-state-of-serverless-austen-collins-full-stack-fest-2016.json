{"description": "The \"serverless architecture\" has become massively popular this year, and for the right reasons. It\u2019s zero-administration nature and pay-per-execution pricing model have removed the major limitations preventing developers from provisioning infinite amounts of logic. Here we chat about the state of the serverless architecture, the vastly intricate, event-driven architectures it will enable in the future, and how empowering it will be for companies and individual developers alike.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nAn early adopter of AWS Lambda, Austen created the Serverless Framework (formerly known as JAWS) to help everyone develop and deploy entire applications onto Lambda and API Gateway. Since then, he's founded Serverless, Inc., which was recently funded by the investors behind Docker, New Relic and Meteor. Serverless, Inc., employs some of the most talented engineers in the serverless space and is building tooling to help everyone build and maintain serverless architectures. Austen is a full-stack javascript developer, an infrastructure engineer, a designer and an AWS community hero.\n\nTalk given at Full Stack Fest 2016 (https://www.fullstackfest.com)", "event": {"name": "Fullstack Fest 2016", "nickname": "fullstackfest-2016", "twitter": "fullstackfest", "url": "https://2016.fullstackfest.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "the-state-of-serverless-austen-collins-full-stack-fest-2016", "length": "45:05", "likes": "32", "recorded": "2016-09-05", "short_description": "The serverless architecture has become massively popular this year, and for the right reasons.
