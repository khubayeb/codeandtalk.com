{"description": "Building User Interfaces is hard. Building them in 3D worlds (virtual reality) is harder. Building them mixing 2D and 3D elements in a web browser is literally a technology frontier project. Doing it maintaining the API and developer friendliness of ReactJS... is what I'll show!\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nSoftware engineer, mostly interested in programming languages and compilers. Started as a Javascript hater but this changed after he worked in the V8 team in Google for about one year and half. Now, among other things, he is working on a virtual reality system for business events on the web: Hyperfair, transitioning it to WebGL and mobile platforms.\n\nTalk given at Full Stack Fest 2016 (https://www.fullstackfest.com)", "event": {"name": "Fullstack Fest 2016", "nickname": "fullstackfest-2016", "twitter": "fullstackfest", "url": "https://2016.fullstackfest.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "reactive-reality-massimiliano-mantione-full-stack-fest-2016", "length": "41:46", "likes": "4", "recorded": "2016-09-05", "short_description": "Building User Interfaces is hard.
