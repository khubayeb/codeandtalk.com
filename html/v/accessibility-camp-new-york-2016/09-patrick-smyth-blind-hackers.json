{"description": "Accessibility Camp NYC - Sep 17 2016\n\n\"When encountering an inaccessible product or design, our first\u2014and often most productive\u2014response includes increasing awareness through outreach and education. But what about when these efforts aren't successful, and the need for access remains? This session is about eyes-free accessibility through the back door, focusing on members of the blind and low vision community that have scraped, soldered, coded, cracked, or hacked their way to accessing otherwise inaccessible designs. From talking Linux and dodging ebook DRM to eyes-free Pokemon, this talk will discuss the ingenuity and persistence of the blind community while opening a dialogue about the ethics of access. Come prepared to play\u2014attendees will have the opportunity to interact with some of these approaches during the talk.\" \n\nSpeaker Bio http://www.smythp.com/ @psmyth01 Patrick Smyth is a Ph.D. student in English and Digital Fellow at The Graduate Center, CUNY.
