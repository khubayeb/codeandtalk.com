{"description": "With Java 8, method references, lambda expressions, and Streams, much of the talk (and buzz) is about \"functional approaches in Java\", and the application of functional programming as Scala, Clojure, and (particularly) Frege had introduced onto the JVM. This however is only part of the story. The other part of it is about a shift from data location orientation, to dataflow orientation. This is not a new message, it is in fact quite an old one. However it is a newly relevant, resurgent, and immensely constructive rethink about software architecture.\n\nIn this session, we will quickly review the old story, investigate the current situation and the variants, and speculate about how this might pan out in the future.", "event": {"name": "Devoxx UK 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-uk-2016", "twitter": "DevoxxUK", "url": "http://www.devoxx.co.uk/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "the-rise-and-rise-of-dataflow-in-the-javaverse-by-russel-winder", "length": "51:23", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-06-08", "short_description": "With Java 8, method references, lambda expressions, and Streams, much of the talk (and buzz) is about functional approaches in J", "speaker_twitters": " @russel_winder", "speakers": {"russel-winder": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "London, UK", "github": "russel", "home": "https://www.russel.org.uk/", "name": "Russel Winder", "twitter": "russel_winder"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Devoxx UK 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-uk-2016", "twitter": "DevoxxUK", "url": "http://www.devoxx.co.uk/"}, "filename": "the-rise-and-rise-of-dataflow-in-the-javaverse-by-russel-winder", "recorded": "2016-06-08", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lKs7x_kauN0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The rise and rise of dataflow in the Javaverse"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lKs7x_kauN0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The rise and rise of dataflow in the Javaverse", "tweet_video": "The%20rise%20and%20rise%20of%20dataflow%20in%20the%20Javaverse%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/devoxx-uk-2016/the-rise-and-rise-of-dataflow-in-the-javaverse-by-russel-winder%20presented%20%40DevoxxUK%20by%20%40russel_winder", "videos": [{"code": "lKs7x_kauN0", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "214"}
