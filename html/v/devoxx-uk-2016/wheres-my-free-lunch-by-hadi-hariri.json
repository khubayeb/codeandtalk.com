{"description": "Have you ever thought about how many amazing things we get in this day and age that are free? Think about it, whether it\u2019s articles in daily newspapers, social media, your code repository, your continuous integration server as a service. And that\u2019s not even mentioning all the amazing open source libraries, frameworks that\u2019s all out there. It\u2019s all free, and it\u2019s awesomesauce!\n\nReality though is someone is paying for all this. Sometimes it\u2019s being paid in cash, other times in the form of data and many times in the form of liabilities, in which we\u2019re also paying. But many of us choose to ignore this and glaze at the wonder of it all. One day however, we\u2019ll wake up and ask, hey, where the hell did my free lunch go, and watch how a lot of things come crumbling down.", "event": {"name": "Devoxx UK 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-uk-2016", "twitter": "DevoxxUK", "url": "http://www.devoxx.co.uk/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "wheres-my-free-lunch-by-hadi-hariri", "length": "20:46", "likes": "11", "recorded": "2016-06-08", "short_description": "Have you ever thought about how many amazing things we get in this day and age that are free?
