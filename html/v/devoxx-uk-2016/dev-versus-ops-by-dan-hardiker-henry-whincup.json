{"description": "DevOps has become a buzz word, it's talked about in many different ways but so often the point about people is quickly forgotten over the technical implementation details. With many organisations barrelling blindly down the road without truly understanding the impact, come hear a couple our experiences - not all of them good!\n\nWith perspectives from both a rock star developer and your average BOFH (er, sys admin), we'll provide an entertaining and sometimes unexpected insights into both aspects of the process, also highlighting some of the pitfalls and blind alleys that we come across along the way.\n\nWe discuss how DevOps varies across different organisation types; from enterprises & governments with legacy IT departments, to new world companies following in Netflix's footsteps; from organisations that are developing software (SaaS or download), to those who just deploy to IT teams.\n\nPlease note - contains a strong dose of sarcasm and British humour!", "event": {"name": "Devoxx UK 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-uk-2016", "twitter": "DevoxxUK", "url": "http://www.devoxx.co.uk/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "dev-versus-ops-by-dan-hardiker-henry-whincup", "length": "50:35", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-06-08", "short_description": "DevOps has become a buzz word, it's talked about in many different ways but so often the point about people is quickly forgotten", "speaker_twitters": " @dhardiker @HenryWhincup", "speakers": {"dan-hardiker": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Northampton, UK", "github": "dhardiker", "home": "https://about.me/dhardiker", "name": "Dan Hardiker", "twitter": "dhardiker"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Devoxx UK 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-uk-2016", "twitter": "DevoxxUK", "url": "http://www.devoxx.co.uk/"}, "filename": "dev-versus-ops-by-dan-hardiker-henry-whincup", "recorded": "2016-06-08", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tIYPATalcGs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Dev versus Ops"}, {"event": {"name": "Devoxx UK 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-uk-2016", "twitter": "DevoxxUK", "url": "http://www.devoxx.co.uk/"}, "filename": "future-of-development-panel", "recorded": "2016-06-08", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pcWNlu7NMKU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Future of Development Panel"}]}, "henry-whincup": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"home": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/techiebod", "name": "Henry Whincup", "twitter": "HenryWhincup"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Devoxx UK 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-uk-2016", "twitter": "DevoxxUK", "url": "http://www.devoxx.co.uk/"}, "filename": "dev-versus-ops-by-dan-hardiker-henry-whincup", "recorded": "2016-06-08", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tIYPATalcGs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Dev versus Ops"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tIYPATalcGs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Dev versus Ops", "tweet_video": "Dev%20versus%20Ops%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/devoxx-uk-2016/dev-versus-ops-by-dan-hardiker-henry-whincup%20presented%20%40DevoxxUK%20by%20%40dhardiker%20by%20%40HenryWhincup", "videos": [{"code": "tIYPATalcGs", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "53"}
