{"description": "The first era of Java EE was XML-driven. The second era of Java EE, brought about by Java 5, is annotation-driven and very declarative by nature. With the advent of Java 8 features such as lambdas and method references, logic is mobile and Java EE has the opportunity to reinvent itself, this time from the declarative to the programmatic. This session explores the possibilities by taking APIs for asynchronous methods, scheduling work, Bean Validation, interceptors and more and seeing how they might be fundamentally changed with the new tools we have and how CDI extensions might play a critical role in this shift. Of course, change does not happen overnight. It\u2019ll take all our ideas to reach the full potential of the Java EE 8 opportunity. Bring your Java 8 or Java EE expertise and join this session to collaboratively explore how those two worlds might be merged.", "event": {"name": "Devoxx UK 2016", "nickname": "devoxx-uk-2016", "twitter": "DevoxxUK", "url": "http://www.devoxx.co.uk/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "java-ee-8-functional-opportunities-by-david-blevins", "length": "52:50", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-06-08", "short_description": "The first era of Java EE was XML-driven.
