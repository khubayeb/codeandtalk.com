{"description": "We're a development team working on B2B healthcare applications written in Clojure. As an experiment, we put started to use the Datomic database for some small-scale production applications in early 2015. Over the course of a year, we've gathered more experience with using Datomic, learned to appreciate its features and hate its weaknesses. In the talk, I will show some usage patterns and techniques that are enabled (or enforced) by Datomic's architecture and feature set.", "event": {"name": "PolyConf - Polyglot Programmers Unite - 2016", "nickname": "polyconf-2016", "twitter": "", "url": "http://polyconf.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "polyconf-16-datomic-in-production-1-year-in-hans-hubner", "length": "26:15", "likes": "10", "recorded": "2016-06-30", "short_description": "We're a development team working on B2B healthcare applications written in Clojure.
