{"abstract": "https://jsconfbp.com/speakers/maurice-de-beijer.html", "description": "Most React-Flux applications just store the data being edited as is in a database. While it is perfectly fine to treat data in a simple CRUD fashion like this with a smaller application this is not very optimal when applications get more complex. For more complex applications using the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) design pattern together with Event-Sourcing (ES) is a much more powerful solution.\n\nWith Event-Sourcing every action leading up to the current state is stored as a separate domain event. This collection of domain events is then used as the write model in the CQRS model. These same events are projected out to a secondary database to build the read model for the application. In this session Maurice de Beijer will explain why you might want to use Event-Sourcing and how to get started with this design in your React and Flux applications.\n\nhttp://jsconfbp.com/speakers/maurice-de-beijer.html", "event": {"name": "JSConf Budapest 2016", "nickname": "jsconf-budapest-2016", "twitter": "jsconfbp", "url": "https://jsconfbp.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "maurice-de-beijer-event-sourcing-your-react-flux-applications-jsconf-budapest-2016", "length": "26:25", "likes": "11", "recorded": "2016-05-12", "short_description": "Most React-Flux applications just store the data being edited as is in a database.
