From mouse to keyboard to joystick, it is game over. Today it is the era of gestures. Today\u2019s gamers can do everything from slice and dice produce in Fruit Ninja to quest for a dragon in Skyrim. We\u2019ve been captivated by these powerful, natural, and intuitive interactions; imagining what it would be like to have that power at our own fingertips.\n\nIn this recent decade, we\u2019ve seen some staggering advances in technologies bring us closer making these magical experiences a reality. In this talk I will present how we can create new, intuitive, interactions for these novel input devices using JavaScript.\n\nhttp://jsconfbp.com/speakers/princiya-sequeira.html", "event": {"name": "JSConf Budapest 2016", "nickname": "jsconf-budapest-2016", "twitter": "jsconfbp", "url": "https://jsconfbp.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "princiya-sequeira-natural-user-interface-using-javascript-jsconf-budapest-2016", "length": "29:17", "likes": "15", "recorded": "2016-05-12", "short_description": "The way we interacted with computers on a large scale was stuck in place for roughly 20 years.
