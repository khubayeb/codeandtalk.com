{"abstract": "https://jsconfbp.com/speakers/denys-mishunov.html", "description": "Load a page in less than a second; reduce the number of server requests; keep your CSS and JS merged and compressed to keep them under 50 kilobytes\u201d \u2013 these are just a few among technical solutions and recommendations we are getting in the industry to tackle performance issues. But there is one catch \u2013 your users don\u2019t care about absolute values in kilobytes, milliseconds and number of requests.\n\nPerformance is not about Mathematics. Performance is about Perception. Perception is what makes a site with a very few requests nevertheless feel slow, while a site that delivers search results during tens of seconds can feel fast enough for your user. User\u2019s perception of your website\u2019s speed is the only true performance measure.\n\nThis talk is about perception, neuroscience and psychology. The time is ripe to understand performance from the user\u2019s perspective.\n\nhttp://jsconfbp.com/speakers/denys-mishunov.html", "event": {"name": "JSConf Budapest 2016", "nickname": "jsconf-budapest-2016", "twitter": "jsconfbp", "url": "https://jsconfbp.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "denys-mishunov-why-performance-matters-jsconf-budapest-201", "length": "22:21", "likes": "33", "recorded": "2016-05-12", "short_description": "Load a page in less than a second; reduce the number of server requests; keep your CSS and JS merged and compressed to keep them", "speaker_twitters": " @mishunov", "speakers": {"denys-mishunov": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "T\u00f8nsberg, Norway", "github": "mishunov", "home": "http://mishunov.me/", "name": "Denys Mishunov", "twitter": "mishunov"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "JSConf Budapest 2016", "nickname": "jsconf-budapest-2016", "twitter": "jsconfbp", "url": "https://jsconfbp.com/"}, "filename": "denys-mishunov-why-performance-matters-jsconf-budapest-201", "recorded": "2016-05-12", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j9TrSkLZa5A/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Why Performance Matters"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j9TrSkLZa5A/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Why Performance Matters", "tweet_video": "Why%20Performance%20Matters%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/jsconf-budapest-2016/denys-mishunov-why-performance-matters-jsconf-budapest-201%20presented%20%40jsconfbp%20by%20%40mishunov", "videos": [{"code": "j9TrSkLZa5A", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "1375"}
