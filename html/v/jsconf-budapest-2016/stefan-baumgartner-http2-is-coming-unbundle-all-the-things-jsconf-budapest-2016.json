{"description": "HTTP - the way how clients and servers talk to each other on the internet - just got a major update. The first update in 15 years! HTTP/2 has landed and promises solutions to all the current performance workarounds we have for web applications: no more image sprites, no more concatenation, no domain sharding tricks. Just deploy like it's 1999! Well, that's at least what we got promised...\n\nIn this session, we will explore the major features of the new HTTP version and its implications for todays JavaScript developers. We will critically analyze recommendations for deployment strategies and find out which impact they have on our current applications, as well as on the applications to come.\n\nhttp://jsconfbp.com/speakers/stefan-baumgartner.html", "event": {"name": "JSConf Budapest 2016", "nickname": "jsconf-budapest-2016", "twitter": "jsconfbp", "url": "https://jsconfbp.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "stefan-baumgartner-http2-is-coming-unbundle-all-the-things-jsconf-budapest-2016", "length": "24:59", "likes": "46", "recorded": "2016-05-12", "short_description": "HTTP - the way how clients and servers talk to each other on the internet - just got a major update.
