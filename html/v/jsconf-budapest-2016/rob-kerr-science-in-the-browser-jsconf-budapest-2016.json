{"abstract": "https://jsconfbp.com/speakers/rob-kerr.html", "description": "Science in the Browser: Orchestrating and Visualising Neural Simulations\n\nOpen-science is about making scientific research accessible to everyone, from other scientists to the general public, but often that means just dumping data sets and publishing the researchers' interpretations. To truly communicate findings and ignite collaboration, we need to expose the tools that the scientists used to analyse the data, simulate the mathematical models, and visualise the results. As a neuroscientist and a web developer, this is something I've been working towards.\n\nMy talk will show how the old-school, computationally-heavy software used in science can be set free using the centralized power of cloud resources and the ubiquity of the browser. We'll see real-time, publicly-broadcast, simulations of the electrical activity in brain cells, visualised in 3D using Javascript.\n\nhttp://jsconfbp.com/speakers/rob-kerr.html", "event": {"name": "JSConf Budapest 2016", "nickname": "jsconf-budapest-2016", "twitter": "jsconfbp", "url": "https://jsconfbp.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "rob-kerr-science-in-the-browser-jsconf-budapest-2016", "length": "36:53", "likes": "17", "recorded": "2016-05-12", "short_description": "Science in the Browser: Orchestrating and Visualising Neural Simulations Open-science is about making scientific research access", "speaker_twitters": " @robrkerr", "speakers": {"rob-kerr": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Melbourne, Australia", "github": "robrkerr", "name": "Rob Kerr", "twitter": "robrkerr"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "JSConf Budapest 2016", "nickname": "jsconf-budapest-2016", "twitter": "jsconfbp", "url": "https://jsconfbp.com/"}, "filename": "rob-kerr-science-in-the-browser-jsconf-budapest-2016", "recorded": "2016-05-12", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mz4N3U5f2tg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Science in the Browser"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mz4N3U5f2tg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Science in the Browser", "tweet_video": "Science%20in%20the%20Browser%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/jsconf-budapest-2016/rob-kerr-science-in-the-browser-jsconf-budapest-2016%20presented%20%40jsconfbp%20by%20%40robrkerr", "videos": [{"code": "mz4N3U5f2tg", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "1297"}
