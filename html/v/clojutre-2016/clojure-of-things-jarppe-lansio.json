{"description": "Business Insider estimates that by 2020 there will be 24 billion IoT devices connected to the Internet. McKinsey estimates that IoT has an economic impact between $3.9 to $11.1 trillion by the year 2025. I estimate that by the 2017 all IoT applications are written in Clojure. Or, at least they should be.\n\nWe have been implementing a simple proof of concept for an IoT solution for Flowrox. In this talk I explain the choices we have made and demonstrate why I think Clojure is ideal technology for IoT applications. I'll try to provide some ideas for both seasoned Clojurians and for newbies.", "event": {"name": "ClojuTRE 2016", "nickname": "clojutre-2016", "twitter": "clojutre", "url": "http://clojutre.org/2016/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "clojure-of-things-jarppe-lansio", "length": "23:40", "likes": "13", "recorded": "2016-09-16", "short_description": "Business Insider estimates that by 2020 there will be 24 billion IoT devices connected to the Internet.
