{"description": "A long time ago, all the developers had a common dream. The dream was about interactivity, liveness, evaluation...\n\nBut we put this dream aside - because the browser understands only javascript.\n\nAnd after a while, we even forgot that we ever had this dream.\n\nKLIPSE is a step toward achieving this dream\n\nKLIPSE provides a simple way for developers to share their code interactively i.e. the shared code is editable and runnable.\n\nIn this talk, we are going to demonstrate a range of applications of KLIPSE.\n\nThe talk will entirely be made of live demos (no powerpoint at all!):\n\n1. how to leverage the klipse app\n2. how share a gist with klipse\n3. how to write a blog post with interactive code snippets\n4. interactive documentation of your clojure[script] library\n\nSlides: http://slides.klipse.tech/klipse-clojutre-2016/", "event": {"name": "ClojuTRE 2016", "nickname": "clojutre-2016", "twitter": "clojutre", "url": "http://clojutre.org/2016/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "interactive-clojure-code-snippets-in-any-web-page-with-klipse-yehonathan-sharvit", "length": "23:42", "likes": "7", "recorded": "2016-09-16", "short_description": "A long time ago, all the developers had a common dream.
