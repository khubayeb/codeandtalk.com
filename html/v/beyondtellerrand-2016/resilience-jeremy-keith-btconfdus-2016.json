{"abstract": "https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2016/speakers/jeremy-keith#talk", "description": "Web browsers have become so powerful that developers are now treating them as if they were a runtime environment as predictable as any other. But the truth is that we still need to deal with many unknown factors that torpedo our assumptions. The web is where Postel\u2019s Law meets Murphy\u2019s Law, so we can\u2019t treat web development as if it were just another flavor of software. Instead we must work with the grain of the web. There are tried and tested approaches to building for the web that will result in experiences that are robust, flexible, and resilient.\n---------------\n\nTalk & speaker bio:\nhttps://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2016/speakers/jeremy-keith\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWatch this little recap video to get an impression how beyond tellerrand events look like:\nhttp://vimeo.com/69823900\n\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/btconf", "event": {"name": "Beyond Tellerrand 2016", "nickname": "beyondtellerrand-2016", "twitter": "btconf", "url": "https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-31", "filename": "resilience-jeremy-keith-btconfdus-2016", "length": "46:14", "likes": "2", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Web browsers have become so powerful that developers are now treating them as if they were a runtime environment as predictable ", "speaker_twitters": " @adactio", "speakers": {"jeremy-keith": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Brighton, UK", "github": "adactio", "home": "https://adactio.com/", "name": "Jeremy Keith", "twitter": "adactio"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Beyond Tellerrand 2015", "nickname": "beyondtellerrand-2015", "twitter": "btconf", "url": "https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2015"}, "filename": "jeremy-keith-enhance-btconfdus2015", "recorded": "2015-05-11", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K9oY9Nwo1R8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Enhance!"}, {"event": {"name": "Beyond Tellerrand 2016", "nickname": "beyondtellerrand-2016", "twitter": "btconf", "url": "https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2016"}, "filename": "resilience-jeremy-keith-btconfdus-2016", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FkP_v1z4-UI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Resilience"}, {"event": {"name": "Full Frontal - ffconf 2013", "nickname": "ffconf-2013", "twitter": "ffconf", "url": "https://2013.ffconf.org/"}, "filename": "8-time", "recorded": "2013-11-08", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pguQjFFgB68/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Time"}, {"event": {"name": "Nordic JS 2016", "nickname": "nordicjs-2016", "twitter": "nordicjs", "url": "http://2016.nordicjs.com/"}, "filename": "nordicjs-2016-jeremy-keith-resilience-tried-and-tested-approaches", "recorded": "2016-09-08", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KxsCWCjEi2Q/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Resilience: Tried and tested approaches"}, {"event": {"name": "View Source Berlin 2016", "nickname": "viewsourceconf-berlin-2016", "twitter": "viewsourceconf", "url": "https://viewsourceconf.org/berlin-2016/"}, "filename": "resilience-view-source-conference-closing-keynote-by-jeremy-keith", "recorded": "2016-09-13", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W7wj7EDrSko/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Resilience"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FkP_v1z4-UI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Resilience", "tweet_video": "Resilience%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/beyondtellerrand-2016/resilience-jeremy-keith-btconfdus-2016%20presented%20%40btconf%20by%20%40adactio", "videos": [{"code": "FkP_v1z4-UI", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "79"}
