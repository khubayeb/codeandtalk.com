But none are as effective as not coding something in the first place. Code that don't exist is infinitely performant and extremely easy to maintain and document. This talk will identify some examples of front-end code that are either not needed at all, make the interface worse just by being there, or can be replaced by something much, much simpler. Say hello to unprogressive non-enhancement.\n---------------\n\nTalk & speaker bio:\nhttps://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2016/speakers/heydon-pickering\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWatch this little recap video to get an impression how beyond tellerrand events look like:\nhttp://vimeo.com/69823900\n\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/btconf", "event": {"name": "Beyond Tellerrand 2016", "nickname": "beyondtellerrand-2016", "twitter": "btconf", "url": "https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-31", "filename": "writing-less-damned-code-heydon-pickering-btconfber2016", "length": "39:21", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Concatenating, minifying, compressing, caching: all serviceable ways to improve the performance of web interfaces.
