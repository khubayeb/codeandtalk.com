{"abstract": "https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2016/speakers/david-jonathan-ross#talk", "description": "Reading a block of code is quite unlike reading a paragraph of text. Text is usually meant to be read, while code is meant to be scanned, parsed, edited, copied, pasted, tested, and debugged. As a result, the typography of programming is a relatively new and different typographic animal.\n\nDavid will examine a world of typography where letters squeeze and stretch to fit in fixed-width spaces, and where a missing semicolon can be the difference between celebration and catastrophe. He'll review the evolution of monospaced typefaces from typewriters to terminals, review stand-out contemporary monospaced designs, and share his experience creating Input, a superfamily of fonts designed specifically for code. Finally, David will share some thoughts on how we can continue to create richer environments for programming typography.\n---------------\n\nTalk & speaker bio:\nhttps://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2016/speakers/david-jonathan-ross\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWatch this little recap video to get an impression how beyond tellerrand events look like:\nhttp://vimeo.com/69823900\n\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/btconf", "event": {"name": "Beyond Tellerrand 2016", "nickname": "beyondtellerrand-2016", "twitter": "btconf", "url": "https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-31", "filename": "cracking-the-code-david-jonathan-ross-btconfdus-2016", "length": "43:16", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "short_description": "Reading a block of code is quite unlike reading a paragraph of text.
