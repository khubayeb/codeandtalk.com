{"description": "The CloudBees Assurance Program is an evolved delivery train that provides stable releases on a predictable schedule, while retaining enough flexibility so that major upgrade windows are wide enough for a broad range of policies. A key part of the program are CloudBees-verified components. The CloudBees-verified components are comprised of both the verified Jenkins core as an extension of the current Long-Term Support (LTS) lines, and a set of verified plugins, which is a translation of the same delivery model for a set of selected OSS plugins. This talk will present a guide through the benefits of the program and the main use cases, as well as insight into all the processes involved in making it a reality.", "event": {"name": "Jenkins World 2016", "nickname": "jenkinsworld-2016", "twitter": "jenkinsconf", "url": "https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2017-01-08", "filename": "jenkins-world-2016-cloudbees-assurance-program-and-cloudbees-verified", "length": "42:08", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-09-14", "short_description": "The CloudBees Assurance Program is an evolved delivery train that provides stable releases on a predictable schedule, while reta", "speaker_twitters": " @Tracy_Kennedy", "speakers": {"andres-rodriguez": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Sevilla, Spain", "github": "andresrc", "home": "http://blog.derquinse.net/", "name": "Andres Rodriguez"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Jenkins World 2016", "nickname": "jenkinsworld-2016", "twitter": "jenkinsconf", "url": "https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home"}, "filename": "jenkins-world-2016-cloudbees-assurance-program-and-cloudbees-verified", "recorded": "2016-09-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cMlqxxEKccs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "CloudBees Assurance Program and CloudBees Verified"}]}, "tracy-kennedy": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "San Jose, CA, USA", "home": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracy-kennedy-154a813a", "name": "Tracy Kennedy", "twitter": "Tracy_Kennedy"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Jenkins World 2016", "nickname": "jenkinsworld-2016", "twitter": "jenkinsconf", "url": "https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home"}, "filename": "jenkins-world-2016-cloudbees-assurance-program-and-cloudbees-verified", "recorded": "2016-09-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cMlqxxEKccs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "CloudBees Assurance Program and CloudBees Verified"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cMlqxxEKccs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "CloudBees Assurance Program and CloudBees Verified", "tweet_video": "CloudBees%20Assurance%20Program%20and%20CloudBees%20Verified%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/jenkinsworld-2016/jenkins-world-2016-cloudbees-assurance-program-and-cloudbees-verified%20presented%20%40jenkinsconf%20by%20%40Tracy_Kennedy", "videos": [{"code": "cMlqxxEKccs", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "35"}
