{"description": "While Docker has enabled an unprecedented velocity of software production, it is all too easy to spin out of control. A promotion-based model is required to control and track the flow of Docker images as much as it is required for a traditional software development lifecycle. We will demonstrate how to go from development to containerization to distribution utilizing binary management promotion in a framework implemented on Jenkins, using the Pipeline functionality.", "event": {"name": "Jenkins World 2016", "nickname": "jenkinsworld-2016", "twitter": "jenkinsconf", "url": "https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2017-01-08", "filename": "jenkins-world-2016-docker-image-lifecycle-implemented-with-jenkins-pipeline", "length": "41:01", "likes": "2", "recorded": "2016-09-14", "short_description": "While Docker has enabled an unprecedented velocity of software production, it is all too easy to spin out of control.
