In this talk, we will review each step of our analytics journey, including how to:\n\n- Set up a continuous delivery pipeline using the Pipeline plugin \n- Extract logs from Jenkins using Apache Flume\n- Correlate data and group with a simple Spark job\n- Display and understand your cycle time\n\nThe presentation and live exercises will be done using Docker VMs, which will be shared and are able to be reused.", "event": {"name": "Jenkins World 2016", "nickname": "jenkinsworld-2016", "twitter": "jenkinsconf", "url": "https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2017-01-08", "filename": "jenkins-world-2016-speed-up-your-continuous-delivery-pipeline-with-jenkins", "length": "43:57", "likes": "7", "recorded": "2016-09-14", "short_description": "This talk is to share our journey and experience in dealing with the collection/analysis of continuous delivery log events using", "speaker_twitters": " @lucamilanesio", "speakers": {"luca-milanesio": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "London, UK", "github": "lucamilanesio", "home": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucamilanesio", "name": "Luca Milanesio", "twitter": "lucamilanesio"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Jenkins World 2016", "nickname": "jenkinsworld-2016", "twitter": "jenkinsconf", "url": "https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home"}, "filename": "jenkins-world-2016-speed-up-your-continuous-delivery-pipeline-with-jenkins", "recorded": "2016-09-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iFRfV2y-OxE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Speed up your Continuous Delivery Pipeline with Jenkins"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iFRfV2y-OxE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Speed up your Continuous Delivery Pipeline with Jenkins", "tweet_video": "Speed%20up%20your%20Continuous%20Delivery%20Pipeline%20with%20Jenkins%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/jenkinsworld-2016/jenkins-world-2016-speed-up-your-continuous-delivery-pipeline-with-jenkins%20presented%20%40jenkinsconf%20by%20%40lucamilanesio", "videos": [{"code": "iFRfV2y-OxE", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "646"}
