{"description": "In recent years, developers have become rapidly attracted to tools that are not only functional but are designed to fit seamlessly into their workflow and are a joy to use. This shift represents a higher standard of design and user experience. A standard that Jenkins needs to rise and evolve to meet. We are excited to share and invite the community to join us on a project we have been thinking about over the last few months called Blue Ocean. \n\nBlue Ocean is a project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins, modeling and presenting the process of software delivery by surfacing information that is important to development teams with as few clicks as possible, while still staying true to the extensibility that Jenkins always has had as a core value.", "event": {"name": "Jenkins World 2016", "nickname": "jenkinsworld-2016", "twitter": "jenkinsconf", "url": "https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2017-01-08", "filename": "jenkins-world-2016-blue-ocean-a-new-user-experience-for-jenkins", "length": "51:11", "likes": "11", "recorded": "2016-09-14", "short_description": "In recent years, developers have become rapidly attracted to tools that are not only functional but are designed to fit seamless", "speaker_twitters": " @i386", "speakers": {"james-dumay": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Sydney, Australia", "github": "i386", "home": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameswdumay", "name": "James Dumay", "twitter": "i386"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Jenkins World 2016", "nickname": "jenkinsworld-2016", "twitter": "jenkinsconf", "url": "https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home"}, "filename": "jenkins-world-2016-blue-ocean-a-new-user-experience-for-jenkins", "recorded": "2016-09-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mn61VFdScuk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Blue Ocean: A New User Experience for Jenkins"}, {"event": {"name": "Jenkins World 2016", "nickname": "jenkinsworld-2016", "twitter": "jenkinsconf", "url": "https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home"}, "filename": "jenkins-world-2016-cloudbees-investing-in-the-future-of-jenkins", "recorded": "2016-09-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0UYO7T7BaGU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "CloudBees: Investing in the Future of Jenkins"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mn61VFdScuk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Blue Ocean: A New User Experience for Jenkins", "tweet_video": "Blue%20Ocean%3A%20A%20New%20User%20Experience%20for%20Jenkins%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/jenkinsworld-2016/jenkins-world-2016-blue-ocean-a-new-user-experience-for-jenkins%20presented%20%40jenkinsconf%20by%20%40i386", "videos": [{"code": "mn61VFdScuk", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "5656"}
