{"description": "At Riot Games, we build a lot of software. Come learn how we built an integrated Docker solution using Jenkins that accepts Docker images submitted as build environments by engineers around the company. Our containerized farm now creates over 10,000 containers per week and handles nearly 1,000 jobs at a rate of about 100 jobs per hour. All this is done with readily available, open source Jenkins plugins. We\u2019ll explore lessons learned, best practices and how to scale and build your own system, as well as why we chose to solve the problem this way...and whether or not we succeeded!", "event": {"name": "Jenkins World 2016", "nickname": "jenkinsworld-2016", "twitter": "jenkinsconf", "url": "https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2017-01-08", "filename": "jenkins-world-2016-thinking-inside-the-container-a-continuous-delivery-story", "length": "46:01", "likes": "5", "recorded": "2016-09-14", "short_description": "At Riot Games, we build a lot of software.
