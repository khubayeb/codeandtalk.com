{"description": "This talk reviews how outages of Jenkins have impacted Shutterfly\u2019s ability to perform releases over the years. We\u2019ll share how advances made after each outage have actually helped enable a transition from once a month releases managed by a central team, to a model that allows development teams to easily create their own build and release pipelines and practice continuous delivery while adhering to established change control practices.
