{"description": "The developer workspace has evolved to support every language, framework, paradigm and runtime. Yet, developers are frustrated. They want to do more but cannot, inhibited by workspaces that are non-portable, non-collaborative and difficult to configure. Universal workspaces are essential to allow anyone, anywhere to contribute to a project for better collaboration and speed. Eclipse Che is an open source industry initiative built to deliver on this vision. Its approach to portable workspaces has been embraced by the Eclipse Foundation and others, including Samsung, IBM, SAP, Microsoft, Red Hat and Codenvy, and it was downloaded 100,000 times within the first two weeks of general availability. Che\u2019s platform is extensible and programmable, making it possible for the ecosystem to make it their own with plugins, templates, stacks and assemblies.", "event": {"name": "Jenkins World 2016", "nickname": "jenkinsworld-2016", "twitter": "jenkinsconf", "url": "https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2017-01-08", "filename": "jenkins-world-2016-the-future-of-ides-eclipse-che-the-next-generation-eclipse-ide", "length": "37:40", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-09-14", "short_description": "The developer workspace has evolved to support every language, framework, paradigm and runtime.
