{"description": "Many of us have already experimented with Docker - for example, by running one of the pre-built images from Docker Hub. It is possible that your team might have recognized the benefits that Docker provides in building microservices and the advantages the technology could bring to development, testing, integration and, ultimately, production. However, you must create a comprehensive build pipeline before deploying any containers into a live environment. Integrating containers into a CD pipeline is far from easy. Along with the benefits Docker brings, there are challenges both technically and process-related. This presentation attempts to outline the steps you need to take for a fully-automated Jenkins pipeline that continuously builds, tests and deploys microservices into a Docker Swarm cluster.", "event": {"name": "Jenkins World 2016", "nickname": "jenkinsworld-2016", "twitter": "jenkinsconf", "url": "https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2017-01-08", "filename": "jenkins-world-2016-continuously-deploying-containers-with-jenkins-pipeline-to-docker-swarm-cluster", "length": "49:20", "likes": "6", "recorded": "2016-09-14", "short_description": "Many of us have already experimented with Docker - for example, by running one of the pre-built images from Docker Hub.
