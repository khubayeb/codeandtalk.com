{"description": "GothamGo 2015: /ruby/go by Brittany Wald and Jen Eisenberg\n\nOur journey from Ruby to Go as intermediate developers. We focus on the major challenges we faced in the application we have been building over the past few months, which is a tool to roll features out incrementally to users and collect data about their progress. Those two (language-switch-driven) hurdles were the difficulty in adapting our architecture to a non-MVC design, and our use of Go tools that weren't appropriate (concurrency patterning), which create bloat and confusion while developing the service. \n\nBrittany Wald is a software engineer at Paperless Post, where she has been working with Go on the site's microservice architecture for the past few months. Originally a Ruby developer, she learned Go for last year's GothamGo and is excited to share some of her experiences (and code) from this transition. Brittany's greatest contributions to the internet thus far are her Harry Potter fan theory (which you can find at dracomalfoyisawerewolf.com), and a successful Kickstarter campaign to launch a potato into near-space.\n\nJen Eisenberg is a software engineer at Paperless Post where she works on the Internal Tools team to improve and build systems for other devs. Over the past few months she has been learning and using Go to architect an internal microservice, though she also stays near her Ruby roots. Before Go and Paperless Post, Jen studied linguistics at UMichigan and today she takes hip hop dance classes regularly. No demonstrations. \n\nSee http://gothamgo.com/program#brittany_wald\n\nThis is a replacement (with better audio) of this earlier upload:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSVeHdi7POM", "event": {"name": "GothamGo Conference 2015", "nickname": "gothamgo-2015", "twitter": "gothamgo", "url": "http://gothamgo.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "gothamgo-2015-rubygo-by-brittany-wald-and-jen-eisenberg", "length": "24:01", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2015-10-02", "short_description": "GothamGo 2015: /ruby/go by Brittany Wald and Jen Eisenberg Our journey from Ruby to Go as intermediate developers.
