Common use cases for a private Clouds are Developer and QA teams with the goal to hand over the capability to automatically provision servers as they need them. As a comprehensive hybrid and multi-Cloud platform openQRM provides support for all mainstream virtualisations- and storage technologies plus integration with other cloud systems such as Amazon EC2, Eucalyptus and OpenStack. In addition to the flexible configurable, pure IaaS Cloud features one of the unique features of openQRM platform is a multi-functional system administration environment that enables efficient and automated IT management.\n\nPeppered with tools for \"bare-metal\" and virtual machine deployment, service and system monitoring, high-availability in three layers, network and DNS management, storage and volume management for a wide range of different storage technologies, automated IT documentation and automatic installation of different operating systems (Linux, Windows, Android) exceeds the functionality of openQRM far from comparable \"Cloud only\" solutions.\n\nThis presentation provides strategies, recommendations and solutions for 100% automated IT environments and presents various use-cases of the openQRM Cloud IaaS platform. In a particular focus for this presentation are the completely revised openQRM Cloud portal and support for the Android OS in the cloud.\n\nMatt Rechenburg is project manager of the openQRM project and CEO of openQRM Enterprise. Since many years he is involved in all kinds of Datacenter-related Open Source projects like high-performance and high-availability clustering, consolidation, network and enterprise storage management. His most serious interests are the different virtualization technologies, their features and capabilities and integration by a unified virtualization layer.\n\nopenQRM Project: http://sourceforge.net/projects/openqrm/\nopenQRM Enterprise: http://www.openqrm-enterprise.com/\n\n\nT-DOSE is a free and yearly event held in The Netherlands to promote use and development of Open Source Software.
