{"abstract": "http://www.t-dose.org/2014/talks/building-business-continuity-plan-bareos-and-rear", "description": "Business Continuity (BC) Management is often confused with Disaster Recovery (DR) Planning as often BC steps are mentioned as part of a DR handbook. During this talk we will highlight what BC is all about and how to get started with it. Creating a DR Plan for certain key systems is only a small part of BC Management and as an example we will illustrate how a central backup server (using BAREOS backup software) plays an important role in DR scenarios of keys systems of your datacenter.\n<p>\nHowever, when the backup server itself is lost you need to foresee a recovery plan for it as well. To fill that gab you could use a disaster recovery tool such as Relax-and-Recover (rear) to restore the Bareos server from bare-metal.\n<p>\nGratien D'haese is a Belgian independent IT Consultant who is already over 25 years active in the Unix world (and with Linux since its invention in 1991). Gratien has a broad experience with Unix in general, Unix networking and security, big system administration tasks, clustering, consultancy and project management.\nGratien is quite active in the Unix/Linux Open Source world and is giving talks around various topics since the days of the Belgian UNIX Users Group and other organizations promoting Unix/Linux and the Open Source movement.\nOn occasions he talks about his projects on conferences, such as at Fosdem, LinuxTag, T-Dose, OSBC and LOAD with talks around Relax-and-Recover, IPv6, adhocr.\nGratien is the co-founder and main designer of <a href=\"http://relax-and-recover.org/\">Relax-and-Recover</a> (rear) together with Schlomo Schapiro (from Germany). This project started in 2006 and the software is part of Fedora, EPEL and SLES HA - \nGratien is also involved with other Open Source projects, such as Upgrade-UX, \"Make CD-ROMRecovery (mkcdrec)\" (which is the forerunner of rear), WBEMextras, adhcor, CFG2HTML,SANmigration, sgesap_validation, c4 and dupro.\n\n", "event": {"name": "T-DOSE 2014", "nickname": "t-dose-2014", "twitter": "TDOSE", "url": "http://www.t-dose.org/2014/schedule"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "t-dose-2014-building-a-business-continuity-plan-with-bareos-and-rear-gratien-dhaese", "length": "50:45", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2014-10-25", "short_description": "Business Continuity (BC) Management is often confused with Disaster Recovery (DR) Planning as often BC steps are mentioned as pa", "speaker_twitters": " @gratiendh", "speakers": {"gratien-dhaese": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Antwerp, Belgium", "github": "gdha", "home": "http://www.it3.be/", "name": "Gratien D'haese", "twitter": "gratiendh"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "T-DOSE 2012", "nickname": "t-dose-2012", "twitter": "TDOSE", "url": "http://www.t-dose.org/2012/schedule"}, "filename": "t-dose-2012-open-source-gratien-dhaese-ad-hoc-copy-and-run-adhocr", "recorded": "2012-10-27", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z-7X80Hv4j4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Ad-hoc Copy and Run (adhocr)"}, {"event": {"name": "T-DOSE 2014", "nickname": "t-dose-2014", "twitter": "TDOSE", "url": "http://www.t-dose.org/2014/schedule"}, "filename": "t-dose-2014-building-a-business-continuity-plan-with-bareos-and-rear-gratien-dhaese", "recorded": "2014-10-25", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cNwa2KE5zUU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Building a Business Continuity Plan with Bareos and rear"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cNwa2KE5zUU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Building a Business Continuity Plan with Bareos and rear", "tweet_video": "Building%20a%20Business%20Continuity%20Plan%20with%20Bareos%20and%20rear%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/t-dose-2014/t-dose-2014-building-a-business-continuity-plan-with-bareos-and-rear-gratien-dhaese%20presented%20%40TDOSE%20by%20%40gratiendh", "videos": [{"code": "cNwa2KE5zUU", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "466"}
