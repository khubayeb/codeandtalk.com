You will be really looking forward to seeing CSS4 Color implemented in all the browsers (and the HTML/CSS to PDF converters). And just maybe, you will be kinda pissed we had to wait this long to get what print media has taken for granted for decades, now.\n\nIf you go out and buy a wide-gamut, calibrated monitor after this, I disclaim all responsibility :)", "event": {"name": "You Gotta Love Frontend Conference 2016", "nickname": "yougottalovefrontend-2016", "twitter": "YGLFConf", "url": "http://yougottalovefrontend.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "chris-lilley-the-evolution-of-css4-color", "length": "33:45", "likes": "3", "recorded": "2016-06-27", "short_description": "New in CSS4 Color: ICC profiles!
