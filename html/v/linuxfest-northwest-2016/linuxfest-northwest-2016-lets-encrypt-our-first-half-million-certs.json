Many of these sites had never before offered secure connections, and many were able to get up and running in a matter of minutes. We're on track to become one of the largest publicly-trusted certificate authorities in the web's public key infrastructure.\n\nIn this presentation, I'll describe how it works, give a live demo involving issuance of a publicly-trusted certificate for a web site, and explain how you can use Let's Encrypt to quickly and easily turn on HTTPS for your web sites -- or help us improve the reach, ease of use, and reliabilities of our tools.", "event": {"name": "Linuxfest Northwest 2016", "nickname": "linuxfest-northwest-2016", "twitter": "", "url": "https://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "linuxfest-northwest-2016-lets-encrypt-our-first-half-million-certs", "length": "50:02", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-04-23", "short_description": "Last year LinuxFest Northwest attendees heard about our plans to launch a free robotic certificate authority, with the goal of m", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {"seth-schoen": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"home": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Schoen", "name": "Seth Schoen"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Linuxfest Northwest 2016", "nickname": "linuxfest-northwest-2016", "twitter": "", "url": "https://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/2016"}, "filename": "linuxfest-northwest-2016-lets-encrypt-our-first-half-million-certs", "recorded": "2016-04-23", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZTyHwCG8Qio/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Let's Encrypt: Our First Half-Million Certs"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZTyHwCG8Qio/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Let's Encrypt: Our First Half-Million Certs", "tweet_video": "Let%27s%20Encrypt%3A%20Our%20First%20Half-Million%20Certs%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/linuxfest-northwest-2016/linuxfest-northwest-2016-lets-encrypt-our-first-half-million-certs", "videos": [{"code": "ZTyHwCG8Qio", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "154"}
