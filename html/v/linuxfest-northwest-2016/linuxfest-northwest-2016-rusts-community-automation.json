Behind the scenes, Rust is also a community that nurtures new contributors, consistently enforces its code of conduct, and maintains a high-quality codebase.\n\nThis talk will discuss the implementation details, as well as the social motivations and effects, of the customized infrastructure and workflow practices which allow the small core team to have such a significant impact. Come learn about bots which integrate with GitHub to identify and assist new contributors, the \"Not Rocket Science\" process for holding a project's code to high standards without being mean to anyone, and more!", "event": {"name": "Linuxfest Northwest 2016", "nickname": "linuxfest-northwest-2016", "twitter": "", "url": "https://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "linuxfest-northwest-2016-rusts-community-automation", "length": "32:28", "likes": "5", "recorded": "2016-04-23", "short_description": "Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.
