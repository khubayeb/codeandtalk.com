Recover an open file that may have been deleted?\n\nWhat about just a general better understanding of what\u2019s going on with your system?\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the Linux wonderfulness that is /proc. We will go over the directory layout, important files as well as kernel tuneables. The importance of /proc will be reinforced by using strace to show how common commands can pull information form /proc to learn about the runtime of the system. On screen strace will be used to dissect programs such as w and ps and see what files they call from proc to gather their information. The files that are identified will be elaborated on.\n\nAfter seeing how common programs use /proc we will go over how a system admin can use proc to find out which process is using the most swap space or recover a deleted file still being helped open.", "event": {"name": "Linuxfest Northwest 2016", "nickname": "linuxfest-northwest-2016", "twitter": "", "url": "https://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "linuxfest-northwest-2016-its-dangerous-to-go-alone-exploring-proc-with-friends", "length": "54:54", "likes": "2", "recorded": "2016-04-23", "short_description": "Ever wondered how your everyday system tools know how much CPU or Memory a process is using?
