The acceleration of modern development lifecycles and the breakdown of an undocumented software supply chain have opened up new pathways for zombies to enter your software - leaving you exposed to security threats.  Jeff will discuss best practices for implementing an Open Source Software management strategy to detect, track and eliminate the risks associated with Zombie code, so you can continue using/re-using open source safely and effectively.", "event": {"name": "Linuxfest Northwest 2016", "nickname": "linuxfest-northwest-2016", "twitter": "", "url": "https://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "linuxfest-northwest-2016-securing-zombie-code-in-your-software", "length": "59:25", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-04-23", "short_description": "Zombie code, or software that is outdated and contains vulnerable versions of certain components, can live in your code forever ", "speaker_twitters": " @jeffluszcz", "speakers": {"jeff-luszcz": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "San Francisco, CA, USA", "github": "jeffluszcz", "home": "http://www.palamida.com/", "name": "Jeff Luszcz", "twitter": "jeffluszcz"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Linuxfest Northwest 2016", "nickname": "linuxfest-northwest-2016", "twitter": "", "url": "https://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/2016"}, "filename": "linuxfest-northwest-2016-securing-zombie-code-in-your-software", "recorded": "2016-04-23", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u3rq9hgTU2A/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Securing Zombie code in your software"}, {"event": {"name": "Linuxfest Northwest 2016", "nickname": "linuxfest-northwest-2016", "twitter": "", "url": "https://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/2016"}, "filename": "linuxfest-northwest-2016-youre-using-open-source-but-are-you-respecting-it", "recorded": "2016-04-23", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sOZjlik40Kk/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "You\u2019re Using Open Source, but are you respecting it?"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u3rq9hgTU2A/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Securing Zombie code in your software", "tweet_video": "Securing%20Zombie%20code%20in%20your%20software%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/linuxfest-northwest-2016/linuxfest-northwest-2016-securing-zombie-code-in-your-software%20by%20%40jeffluszcz", "videos": [{"code": "u3rq9hgTU2A", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "65"}
