{"abstract": "https://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/2016/sessions/contributors-guide-galaxy", "description": "A contributor's guide to open source/free software projects! This is a case study based on my experience with Debian as a developer from 1999 to 2006. Contributing to an open source project can be a one-time thing, a hobby, or even a full-time job. The contribution itself might be in the form of documentation, code, translation, money, software, hardware, hosting, and the list goes on. No matter how you have contributed in the past, the bottom line is that we need contributors like you to step in and be a leader. Come hear about my experience, the pros and cons, why there needs to be proper management, and what harm is coming to the open source community because of our lack of stepping up and being leaders. Users and developers alike will find a call to action in this talk. Will cover some basics on how to get started as a contributor.", "event": {"name": "Linuxfest Northwest 2016", "nickname": "linuxfest-northwest-2016", "twitter": "", "url": "https://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/2016"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "linuxfest-northwest-2016-the-contributors-guide-to-the-galaxy", "length": "49:16", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-04-23", "short_description": "A contributor's guide to open source/free software projects!
