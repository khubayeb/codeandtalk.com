They can do sweet things like icon morphing that was introduced in material design, create bouncy buttons that let the user know they're clicked, and many other effects that you can image. In this talk, we're going to dive deep into SVGs to learn how to use them, and how to create these cool effects for your own website.\n\nZell is a freelance web developer based in Singapore.
