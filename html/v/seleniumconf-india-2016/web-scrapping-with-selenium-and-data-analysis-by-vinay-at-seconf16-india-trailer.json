{"description": "Data Analysis is one of the upcoming field and as many of the data scientists says that the most of time they spend for analysis is on Data cleaning, So, In this short session we will see how one can pull the data from the web using Selenium Webdriver and will use this data further for the Data Analysis, The entire exercise will be executed on a IPython Notebook, which is a tool used to execute & save your code and perform data analysis using python data analysis libraries, it also provides a platform to massage the data and visualize it in the form of graphs and tables.\n\nThis entire exercise would be helpful for anyone who wants to understand how data can be pulled with the help of Selenium Webdriver from a website and organized using python libraries for the data analysis. During this session we would be using an open source data for analysis and see how we can draw conclusions using this data.\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/proposal/2304\n\nConference: http://2016.seleniumconf.in", "event": {"name": "Selenium Conf India 2016", "nickname": "seleniumconf-india-2016", "twitter": "seleniumconf", "url": "http://2016.seleniumconf.in/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "web-scrapping-with-selenium-and-data-analysis-by-vinay-at-seconf16-india-trailer", "length": "03:06", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-06-24", "short_description": "Data Analysis is one of the upcoming field and as many of the data scientists says that the most of time they spend for analysis", "skipped": 1, "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {"vinay-babu": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"name": "Vinay babu"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Selenium Conf India 2016", "nickname": "seleniumconf-india-2016", "twitter": "seleniumconf", "url": "http://2016.seleniumconf.in/"}, "filename": "web-scrapping-with-selenium-and-data-analysis-by-vinay-at-seconf16-india-trailer", "recorded": "2016-06-24", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDnQV-NSkhM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Web Scrapping with Selenium and Data Analysis"}, {"event": {"name": "Selenium Conf India 2016", "nickname": "seleniumconf-india-2016", "twitter": "seleniumconf", "url": "http://2016.seleniumconf.in/"}, "filename": "web-scrapping-with-selenium-and-data-analysis-by-vinay-at-seconf16-india", "recorded": "2016-06-24", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mS3dzczv1ZQ/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Web Scrapping with Selenium and Data Analysis"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDnQV-NSkhM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Web Scrapping with Selenium and Data Analysis", "tweet_video": "Web%20Scrapping%20with%20Selenium%20and%20Data%20Analysis%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/seleniumconf-india-2016/web-scrapping-with-selenium-and-data-analysis-by-vinay-at-seconf16-india-trailer%20presented%20%40seleniumconf", "videos": [{"code": "jDnQV-NSkhM", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "50"}
