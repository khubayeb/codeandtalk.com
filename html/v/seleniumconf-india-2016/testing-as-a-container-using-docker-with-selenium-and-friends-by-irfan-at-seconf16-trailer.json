{"description": "We see two upcoming trends in the world of software delivery.\n\n1.Docker is becoming a standard for managing infrastructure using containers.\n\n2.Testing code and its infrastructure starts to grow at scale with more complexity, dependencies and technology diversity.\n\nA container is an entire portable runtime environment: an application, plus all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries, and configuration files needed to run it, bundled into one package. By containerizing the application platform and its dependencies ,all differences in OS distributions and underlying infrastructure are abstracted away which makes it easy to share and execute anywhere.\n\nAt this talk we will learn how to leverage the container technology to solve the challenges of growing testing infrastructure and continuous delivery with key focus on below items.\n\nBasics of the containers technology and specifically it\u2019s application on the test automation. \nHow Docker can reduce the time of test execution, ease the setup of clean test environments and drastically reduce the differences between the development, acceptance and production environments leading to the higher quality of the released software.\nExamples to containerize entire testing stack together consisting of major automation tools (selenium, appium, phantomjs), performance tools (jmeter,gatling) with cucumber. \nIntegrating and managing testing container with other application containers to achieve easily manageable continuous delivery pipeline.\nBest practices and patterns for docker success.\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/proposal/2380\n\nConference: http://2016.seleniumconf.in", "event": {"name": "Selenium Conf India 2016", "nickname": "seleniumconf-india-2016", "twitter": "seleniumconf", "url": "http://2016.seleniumconf.in/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "testing-as-a-container-using-docker-with-selenium-and-friends-by-irfan-at-seconf16-trailer", "length": "03:03", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-06-24", "short_description": "We see two upcoming trends in the world of software delivery. 1.Docker is becoming a standard for managing infrastructure using ", "skipped": 1, "speaker_twitters": " @notimewaste", "speakers": {"irfan-ahmad": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Mumbai, India", "github": "irfanah", "home": "http://critick.io/", "name": "Irfan Ahmad", "twitter": "notimewaste"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Selenium Conf India 2016", "nickname": "seleniumconf-india-2016", "twitter": "seleniumconf", "url": "http://2016.seleniumconf.in/"}, "filename": "testing-as-a-container-using-docker-with-selenium-and-friends-by-irfan-at-seconf-india-16", "recorded": "2016-06-24", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CCF6A_HDdcI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Testing as a Container Using Docker with selenium and friends"}, {"event": {"name": "Selenium Conf India 2016", "nickname": "seleniumconf-india-2016", "twitter": "seleniumconf", "url": "http://2016.seleniumconf.in/"}, "filename": "testing-as-a-container-using-docker-with-selenium-and-friends-by-irfan-at-seconf16-trailer", "recorded": "2016-06-24", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cCoYlpmt3LA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Testing as a Container Using Docker with selenium and friends"}, {"event": {"name": "Selenium Conf UK 2016", "nickname": "seleniumconf-uk-2016", "twitter": "seleniumconf_UK", "url": "http://2016.seleniumconf.co.uk/"}, "filename": "think-inside-container-building-reliable-scalable-infrastructure-for-selenium-tests-irfan-ahmed", "recorded": "2016-11-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qYJvwggA6cA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Think Inside Container: Building Reliable & Scalable Infrastructure for Selenium Tests"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cCoYlpmt3LA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Testing as a Container Using Docker with selenium and friends", "tweet_video": "Testing%20as%20a%20Container%20Using%20Docker%20with%20selenium%20and%20friends%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/seleniumconf-india-2016/testing-as-a-container-using-docker-with-selenium-and-friends-by-irfan-at-seconf16-trailer%20presented%20%40seleniumconf%20by%20%40notimewaste", "videos": [{"code": "cCoYlpmt3LA", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "151"}
