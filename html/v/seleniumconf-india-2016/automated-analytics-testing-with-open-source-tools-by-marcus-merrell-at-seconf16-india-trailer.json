{"description": "Analytics are an increasingly important capability of any large web site or application. When a user selects an option or clicks a button, dozens\u2014if not hundreds\u2014of behavior-defining \u201cbeacons\u201d fire off into a black box of \u201cbig data\u201d to be correlated with the usage patterns of thousands of other users. In the end, all these little data points form a constellation of information your organization will use to determine its course. But what if it doesn\u2019t work? A misconfigured site option or an errant variable might seem insignificant, but if 10,000 users are firing 10,000 incorrect values concerning their click patterns, it suddenly becomes a problem for the QA department\u2015a department which is often left out of conversations involving analytics.\n\nJoin Marcus Merrell to learn how analytics work, how to get involved early, and how to integrate analytics testing into the normal QA process, using Selenium and other open source tools, to prevent those misfires from slipping through.\n\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/proposal/2583\n\nConference: http://2016.seleniumconf.in", "event": {"name": "Selenium Conf India 2016", "nickname": "seleniumconf-india-2016", "twitter": "seleniumconf", "url": "http://2016.seleniumconf.in/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "automated-analytics-testing-with-open-source-tools-by-marcus-merrell-at-seconf16-india-trailer", "length": "03:15", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-06-24", "short_description": "Analytics are an increasingly important capability of any large web site or application.
