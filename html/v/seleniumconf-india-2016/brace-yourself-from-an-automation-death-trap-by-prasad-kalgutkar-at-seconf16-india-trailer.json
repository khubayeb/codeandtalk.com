{"description": "We all in the voyage to test effectively always think about test automation & let me tell you, its no less crucial & important than production app code. Its a code/framework/architecture built to test your app code and catch some of app defects. This when placed in an eco-system of continuous integration & deployment takes a next level of importance.\n\nI have been fortunate enough to have had my share of failures & eventually learn out of it while automating. In this session, I wish to take my audience through the importance of automation in Agile, the essentials to think of while deciding the tools and also take some tangible take-aways while writing automation code.\n\nThe take-aways will be some technical inputs which have immensely helped me to build flexible frameworks for delivery of enterprise products. The aspects this take-aways will touch are on the pressings issues an automation tester face around test data management, code modularization, defining the clarity on responsibilities of different modules/classes written in an automation framework.\n\nThis session will be a good dialogue supported with some live demos for better understanding & overall making us think to stay away from the obvious failures.\n\nMore details: https://confengine.com/selenium-conf-2016/proposal/2348\n\nConference: http://2016.seleniumconf.in", "event": {"name": "Selenium Conf India 2016", "nickname": "seleniumconf-india-2016", "twitter": "seleniumconf", "url": "http://2016.seleniumconf.in/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "brace-yourself-from-an-automation-death-trap-by-prasad-kalgutkar-at-seconf16-india-trailer", "length": "03:07", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-06-24", "short_description": "We all in the voyage to test effectively always think about test automation & let me tell you, its no less crucial & important t", "skipped": 1, "speaker_twitters": " @KalgutkarPrasad", "speakers": {"prasad-kalgutkar": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Pune, India", "github": "prasadkalgutkar", "name": "Prasad Kalgutkar", "twitter": "KalgutkarPrasad"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Selenium Conf India 2016", "nickname": "seleniumconf-india-2016", "twitter": "seleniumconf", "url": "http://2016.seleniumconf.in/"}, "filename": "brace-yourself-from-an-automation-death-trap-by-prasad-kalgutkar-at-seconf16-india-trailer", "recorded": "2016-06-24", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OIfcgTNk4-4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Brace yourself from an automation death trap"}, {"event": {"name": "Selenium Conf India 2016", "nickname": "seleniumconf-india-2016", "twitter": "seleniumconf", "url": "http://2016.seleniumconf.in/"}, "filename": "brace-yourself-from-an-automation-death-trap-by-prasad-kalgutkar-at-seconf16-india", "recorded": "2016-06-24", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xzTD5gyXAGI/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Brace yourself from an automation death trap"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OIfcgTNk4-4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Brace yourself from an automation death trap", "tweet_video": "Brace%20yourself%20from%20an%20automation%20death%20trap%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/seleniumconf-india-2016/brace-yourself-from-an-automation-death-trap-by-prasad-kalgutkar-at-seconf16-india-trailer%20presented%20%40seleniumconf%20by%20%40KalgutkarPrasad", "videos": [{"code": "OIfcgTNk4-4", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "35"}
