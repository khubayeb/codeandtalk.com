{"description": "ING bank is facing a challenge in scaling up their mobile app development. The wish list of new features is long and good native mobile engineers are hard to find. A solution could be hybrid app development but there are a lot of preconceptions about this technology. We delivered a solution which tightly integrate native and hybrid and delivers: - seamless user experience o Native close UI implementation using IONIC and extending with custom ING theme o Javascript briges, which integrate the hybrid feature with mobile app extensions points using Cordova framework in a secure way. For example, HttpPlugin intercepts all http requests and route them to the native layer. - Scale to an enterprise level o Continuous integration to enable web developers easily performs integration tests with native extension points, without having knowledge of native app development o ING the guide implements ING visual identity and provides reusable components to use in hybrid solution.", "event": {"name": "ngEurope 2016", "nickname": "ng-europe-2016", "twitter": "ngEurope", "url": "https://ngeurope.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-31", "filename": "willem-veelenturf-wilmveel-embed-hybrid-features-in-mobile-banking-app-at-ng-europe-2016", "length": "21:35", "likes": "11", "recorded": "2016-10-25", "short_description": "ING bank is facing a challenge in scaling up their mobile app development.
