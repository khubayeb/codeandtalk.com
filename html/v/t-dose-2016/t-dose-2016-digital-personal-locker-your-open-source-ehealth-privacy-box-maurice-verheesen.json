{"blasters": ["freedom"], "description": "Your personal data is very valuable. Unfortunately you have less and less control over this data. Especially data about your health.\nThere are a number of large worldwide initiatives that suggest the idea to store this type of data in the cloud.\nNot just of individuals, but on a national and even on European level. Meaning all citizens.\nYou don't have much choice. Hospitals, researchers, insurance companies and tech companies making the choice for you.\n<p>\nI believe users need a choice. Maybe you don't want your data in a cloud.\nMaybe you want your data close and under your direct control. Allowing you to share want you think is ok.\nA free, open and controllable box, compatible with those large initiatives, but where the user is in control of his/her own data.\nI like to call this box the <b>Digital Personal Locker</b>. In this talk I'll explain what it is, why it's necessary and how you can join the initiative.\nI also will show the technical design and hope for critical discussion with you about this! Feedback about what's missing or plain wrong is very very welcome.\n<p>\nRight now I'm gathering the people that are already doing something similar.\nThink about the <a href=\"http://freedomboxfoundation.org/\">Freedombox</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.whitebox.eu/\">WhiteBox</a> and connecting these\npeople with organisations like the <a href=\"https://www.sidn.nl/\">SIDN, the Dutch Tech Center for Life Sciences</a>, <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/\">NLnet</a> and a group of people who don't want their data stored in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips\">Philips</a> - <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/\">SalesForce eHealth cloud</a> (yes you read that correctly, your health data in a US based cloud of a marketing company!).\n<p>\nHope to see you at the presentation and please give feedback and be critical. We need to do this right, open and secure.\n<p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.mrdm.nl/\">MRDM</a></li>\n  <li><q>CIA - Confidentiality - Integrity - Availability</q></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.nerdalize.com/\">Nerdalize</a> Free heating, affordable cloud</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.qiyfoundation.org/\">QIY Foundation</a></li>\n<p>\n", "event": {"name": "T-DOSE 2016", "nickname": "t-dose-2016", "twitter": "TDOSE", "url": "http://www.t-dose.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "featured": "2016-12-14", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "t-dose-2016-digital-personal-locker-your-open-source-ehealth-privacy-box-maurice-verheesen", "length": "23:50", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-11-12", "short_description": "Your personal data is very valuable.
