This is the promise of Domain Specific Languages(DSLs). Unfortunately, the time and cost to build translators and support tools have prevented the construction of these new languages. A Language Workbench reduces the effort to create a DSL tailored for a narrow set of applications.\n\nThis presentation chronicles our efforts to bootstrap a language workbench called Language of Languages and create a minimal viable open source offering.", "event": {"name": "Linuxfest Northwest 2015", "nickname": "linuxfest-northwest-2015", "twitter": "", "url": "https://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/2015"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "linuxfest-northwest-2015-bootstrapping-a-language-workbench", "length": "47:12", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2015-04-25", "short_description": "Andronetta Douglass Jamie Douglass Alyssa Pavao Slides: http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/sites/default/files/slides/Bootstrapping%2", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BA6F3vhe7Kg/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "LinuxFest Northwest 2015: Bootstrapping a Language Workbench", "tweet_video": "LinuxFest%20Northwest%202015%3A%20Bootstrapping%20a%20Language%20Workbench%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/linuxfest-northwest-2015/linuxfest-northwest-2015-bootstrapping-a-language-workbench", "videos": [{"code": "BA6F3vhe7Kg", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "67"}
