{"description": "Software re-use; New opportunities for open source developers and service suppliers.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Marc Vloermans\r\n\r\nGovernments and companies have over time developed various applications either by themselves or suppliers. When looked at from close by, these applications perform more or less the same tasks. In the light of a more sustainable government, draconical budget cuts and company efficiency this seems a luxury we can hardly afford.\r\n\r\nNo wonder a trend has emerged for governements and supply chains to share software and centralize maintenance. This poses unique opportunities for OS software developers and service suppliers to innovate and grow their business.\r\n\r\nDuring the presentation Marc Vloemans will provide a survey of the challenges and opportunities this unique development offers the OS community in the Netherlands and abroad.\r\n\r\nMarc Vloemans\r\n\r\nMarc is strategy advisor and business developer in the area of open technologies and is Partner with the international OS Consultancy Agency 'Age of Peers' (www.ageofpeers.com). He has many years of experience as a strategist and marketeer inside and outside of the open source community. Besides his chairmanship of the OS-supplier association OSSLO (www.osslo.nl) he is speaker, writer ('Open Source Inside') and columnist (www.computable.nl) on open technologies (source, standards and data).
