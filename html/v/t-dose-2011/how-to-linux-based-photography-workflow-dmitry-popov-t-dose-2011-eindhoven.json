{"description": "There are plenty of open source photographic tools available for amateurs and professional photographers using Linux as their platform of choice. The talk will introduce several applications and utilities that can be used to set up a Linux-based photographic workflow: from importing and managing photos to processing RAW files and sharing images on the web. The talk will cover digiKam, Darktable, and Piwigo as well as useful utilities like Rapid Photo Downloader and Geeqie. In addition to that, the talk will provide practical examples of how these tools can be integrated into a seamless photographic workflow.\r\n\r\nDmitri Popov has been writing exclusively about Linux and open source software for many years, and his articles have appeared in Danish, British, US, German, and Russian magazines and websites. Dmitri is an avid amateur photographer, and he writes about open source photography tools on his Scribbles and Snaps blog at scribblesandsnaps.wordpress.com\r\n\r\nTalk: Linux-based Photography Workflow", "event": {"name": "T-DOSE 2011", "nickname": "t-dose-2011", "twitter": "TDOSE", "url": "http://www.t-dose.org/2011/schedule"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "how-to-linux-based-photography-workflow-dmitry-popov-t-dose-2011-eindhoven", "length": "35:09", "likes": "19", "recorded": "2011-11-05", "short_description": "There are plenty of open source photographic tools available for amateurs and professional photographers using Linux as their pl", "speaker_twitters": " @dmpop", "speakers": {"dmitry-popov": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "\u00c5rhus, Denmark", "home": "https://scribblesandsnaps.com/", "name": "Dmitry Popov", "twitter": "dmpop"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "T-DOSE 2011", "nickname": "t-dose-2011", "twitter": "TDOSE", "url": "http://www.t-dose.org/2011/schedule"}, "filename": "how-to-linux-based-photography-workflow-dmitry-popov-t-dose-2011-eindhoven", "recorded": "2011-11-05", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zaVMdqpEW14/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "How to Linux-based Photography Workflow"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zaVMdqpEW14/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "How to Linux-based Photography Workflow", "tweet_video": "How%20to%20Linux-based%20Photography%20Workflow%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/t-dose-2011/how-to-linux-based-photography-workflow-dmitry-popov-t-dose-2011-eindhoven%20presented%20%40TDOSE%20by%20%40dmpop", "videos": [{"code": "zaVMdqpEW14", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "5130"}
