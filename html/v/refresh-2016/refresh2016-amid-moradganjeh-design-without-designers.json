Today design still misses to create the bigger impact it is capable of, mainly because designers have made everyone believe that design is a very specialised field that only they can do. But what happens when we believe everyone can be a designer and let anyone be involved in the design process? Let\u2019s look into cases where we as designers left design to the others and let\u2019s share some stories about teaching design to non-designers.
