{"description": "Interested in Machine Learning and its latest hype Deep Neural Networks? Unfortunately, most libraries in that area have a Python interface that might be a tad hard to install or are not very accessible to a JavaScript developer. Additionally, you might be afraid of the math involved.\n\nIn this talk I will show you how Deep Neural Networks work - leaving out most of the math. I will also introduce a JavaScript framework that easily lets you experiment with Machine Learning.\"", "event": {"name": "RuhrJS 2016", "nickname": "ruhrjs-2016", "twitter": "RuhrJS", "url": "http://www.ruhrjs.de/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "ruhrjs-2016-oliver-zeigermann-machine-learning-with-deep-neural-networks-in-the-browser", "length": "28:41", "likes": "3", "recorded": "2016-07-02", "short_description": "Interested in Machine Learning and its latest hype Deep Neural Networks?
