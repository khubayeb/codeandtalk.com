{"description": "Run your JS code on the GPU! This project is the result of a fun hackathon story of achieving the impossible in 24 hours. YMMV for your actual performance profit through parallelization.\n\nAs a GPU computing and JavaScript enthusiast, Fazli envisioned an easy way to perform GPU inside the browser. Thus, working with a few fellow engineers, gpu.js was created as an online platform that could be used to teach parallel computing concepts to beginners. He is presently working as a software engineer at Garena, and enjoys hacking random stuff together in his free time.\n\nIn his free time, Eugene is constantly tinkering around with technology. From GPU.JS coding, reading up HTML5 specifications, experimenting with his own programming language, etc. For fun. In his work time, he runs his own website and mobile applications development company Picoded Pte Ltd that makes apps for others on demand, for profit.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 25+26 November 2016.\n\nSource: https://2016.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
