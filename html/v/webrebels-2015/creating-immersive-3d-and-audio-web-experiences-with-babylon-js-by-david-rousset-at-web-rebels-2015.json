{"description": "During this session, we will see thanks to babylon.js, a free & open source engine written in TypeScript, how we can easily create and use 3D content with associated sounds directly with JavaScript. We will also see how to interact with DCC tools like Unity or Blender to work with 3D designer. Spatial sounds, gamepad, physics effects: all those goodies are available for you in a few lines of code! Demos will be done in our latest browser engine.", "event": {"name": "Web Rebels 2015", "nickname": "webrebels-2015", "twitter": "web_rebels", "url": "https://2015.webrebels.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "creating-immersive-3d-and-audio-web-experiences-with-babylon-js-by-david-rousset-at-web-rebels-2015", "length": "44:22", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2015-05-21", "short_description": "During this session, we will see thanks to babylon.js, a free & open source engine written in TypeScript, how we can easily crea", "speaker_twitters": " @davidrousset2", "speakers": {"david-rousset": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Paris, France", "github": "davrous", "home": "https://www.davrous.com/", "name": "David Rousset", "twitter": "davidrousset2"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Web Rebels 2015", "nickname": "webrebels-2015", "twitter": "web_rebels", "url": "https://2015.webrebels.org/"}, "filename": "creating-immersive-3d-and-audio-web-experiences-with-babylon-js-by-david-rousset-at-web-rebels-2015", "recorded": "2015-05-21", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/23qJrz1pGvU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Creating immersive 3D and audio web experiences with Babylon js"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/23qJrz1pGvU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Creating immersive 3D and audio web experiences with Babylon js", "tweet_video": "Creating%20immersive%203D%20and%20audio%20web%20experiences%20with%20Babylon%20js%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/webrebels-2015/creating-immersive-3d-and-audio-web-experiences-with-babylon-js-by-david-rousset-at-web-rebels-2015%20presented%20%40web_rebels%20by%20%40davidrousset2", "videos": [{"code": "23qJrz1pGvU", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "212"}
