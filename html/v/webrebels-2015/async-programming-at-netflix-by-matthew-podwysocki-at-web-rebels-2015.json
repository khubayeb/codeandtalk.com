{"description": "What\u2019s does a mouse drag event have in common with an Array of numbers? The answer to this question may surprise you: they are both collections.\nThis key insight holds the key to dramatically simplifying asynchronous programming in JavaScript. In this talk you will learn how you can use the familiar JavaScript Array methods to create surprisingly expressive asynchronous programs.\nUsing just a few functions, you will learn how to do the following:\nDeclaratively build complex events out of simple events (ex. drag n\u2019 drop)\nCoordinate and sequence multiple Ajax requests\nReactively update UI\u2019s in response to data changes\nEliminate memory leaks caused by neglecting to unsubscribe from events\nGracefully propagate and handle asynchronous exception\nIn this talk we\u2019ll be exploring the Reactive Extensions (RxJS) library, which allows us to treat events as collections. You\u2019ll learn about how Netflix uses Rx on the client and the server, allowing us to build end-to-end reactive systems. We\u2019ll also contrast Rx with Promises, another popular approach to building asynchronous programs in JavaScript.", "event": {"name": "Web Rebels 2015", "nickname": "webrebels-2015", "twitter": "web_rebels", "url": "https://2015.webrebels.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "async-programming-at-netflix-by-matthew-podwysocki-at-web-rebels-2015", "length": "40:26", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2015-05-21", "short_description": "What\u2019s does a mouse drag event have in common with an Array of numbers?
