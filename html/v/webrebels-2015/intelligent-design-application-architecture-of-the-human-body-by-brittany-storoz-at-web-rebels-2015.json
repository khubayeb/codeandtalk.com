{"description": "Over time, we've developed solid conventions and best practices for building our applications with a sustainable architecture. We've explained them in writing and highlighted them in demonstrative apps, but the most exemplary instance of application architecture will not be found in the pages of a book or code in a text editor.\nRather, it's found in the modularity of our organs. It's found in the speed of complex communication between our brains and our bodies. It's found in the processes like breathing and blinking that run seamlessly in our backgrounds.\nOur bodies consistently demonstrate the best practices and patterns we aim for in our software every day. Let's investigate how our biology makes the most irrefutable case for the designs we've come to value in application development.", "event": {"name": "Web Rebels 2015", "nickname": "webrebels-2015", "twitter": "web_rebels", "url": "https://2015.webrebels.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "intelligent-design-application-architecture-of-the-human-body-by-brittany-storoz-at-web-rebels-2015", "length": "29:25", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2015-05-21", "short_description": "Over time, we've developed solid conventions and best practices for building our applications with a sustainable architecture.
