{"abstract": "http://www.pgconf.us/2016/event/199/postgresql-ha-database-clusters-through-containment/", "description": "The enormous amount of data flow has made Relation Database Management System the most important and popular tools for persistence of data. While open-source RDBMS systems are not as widely used as proprietary systems like Oracle databases, but over the years, systems like PostgreSQL have gained massive popularity. High-availability database clusters (also known as HA clusters or failover clusters) are groups of computers that support server applications that can be reliably utilized with a minimum of down-time. This presentation is an attempt to set a benchmark of PostgreSQL high-availability databases in comparing the performance of same-containment keepalived-repmgr clusters against cross-containment HAProxy-PgBouncer clusters. The result shows that our cross-containment HAProxy-PgBouncer is still a significantly better performer with load balancing, healthcheck and its throughputs are improved from 0.346% to 9.454% in compared to keepalived-repmgr. Also we would like to present I/O activities and CPU usage percentages between the two kinds of PostgreSQL HA clusters.", "event": {"name": "PGConf US 2016", "nickname": "pgconfus-2016", "twitter": "pgconfus", "url": "http://www.pgconf.us/2016/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "postgresql-ha-database-clusters-through-containment-quan-ha-le-mp4", "length": "44:47", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-04-18", "short_description": "The enormous amount of data flow has made Relation Database Management System the most important and popular tools for persisten", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {"quan-ha-le": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"name": "Quan Ha Le (l\u00ea ha\u0309i qu\u00e2n)"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "PGConf US 2016", "nickname": "pgconfus-2016", "twitter": "pgconfus", "url": "http://www.pgconf.us/2016/"}, "filename": "postgresql-ha-database-clusters-through-containment-quan-ha-le-mp4", "recorded": "2016-04-18", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KGcqysqyKb8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "PostgreSQL HA Database Clusters through Containment"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KGcqysqyKb8/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "PostgreSQL HA Database Clusters through Containment", "tweet_video": "PostgreSQL%20HA%20Database%20Clusters%20through%20Containment%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/pgconfus-2016/postgresql-ha-database-clusters-through-containment-quan-ha-le-mp4%20presented%20%40pgconfus", "videos": [{"code": "KGcqysqyKb8", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "114"}
