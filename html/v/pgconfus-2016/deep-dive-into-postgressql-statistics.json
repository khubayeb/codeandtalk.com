This helps Postgres to estimate its\neffectiveness and act to improve the performance. However, there is a\nlot of this information and statistics, and it is too complex to be\ninterpreted easily. Statistics processing and correct interpretation\nis not an easy task itself, but, to make the matter worse, there are\nplenty of available tools that may confuse even an experienced DBA.", "event": {"name": "PGConf US 2016", "nickname": "pgconfus-2016", "twitter": "pgconfus", "url": "http://www.pgconf.us/2016/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "deep-dive-into-postgressql-statistics", "length": "42:01", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-04-18", "short_description": "PostgreSQL RDBMS is a complex piece of software that comprises many subsystems, and its overall performance depends on these sub", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {"alexey-lesovsky": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Yekaterinburg, Russian Federation", "github": "lesovsky", "home": "http://www.thislinux.org/", "name": "Alexey Lesovsky"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "PGConf US 2016", "nickname": "pgconfus-2016", "twitter": "pgconfus", "url": "http://www.pgconf.us/2016/"}, "filename": "deep-dive-into-postgressql-statistics", "recorded": "2016-04-18", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4wUZBKGw7Xs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Deep Dive into PostgresSQL Statistics"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4wUZBKGw7Xs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Deep Dive into PostgresSQL Statistics", "tweet_video": "Deep%20Dive%20into%20PostgresSQL%20Statistics%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/pgconfus-2016/deep-dive-into-postgressql-statistics%20presented%20%40pgconfus", "videos": [{"code": "4wUZBKGw7Xs", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "137"}
