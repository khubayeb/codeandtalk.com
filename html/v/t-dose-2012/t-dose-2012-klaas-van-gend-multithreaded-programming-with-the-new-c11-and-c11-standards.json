{"description": "2011 Finally saw the publication of the new C11 and C++11 standards. Both standards finally add multithreading to the standard language and libraries, fortunately in an interoperable way. Especially the C++11 standard adds some really neat ways that change the way programmers will think about multithreaded code.\n\nKlaas will introduce the new features of both the C11 and C++11 languages and discuss how far gcc and clang are implementing the new standards.\n\nKlaas is very enthusiastic about the new versions of both programming languages - it will make his professional life a lot easier.\n\nWarning: this is a talk about updates to programming languages. Some people consider watching a still wet painting of growing grass to be more exciting.", "event": {"name": "T-DOSE 2012", "nickname": "t-dose-2012", "twitter": "TDOSE", "url": "http://www.t-dose.org/2012/schedule"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "t-dose-2012-klaas-van-gend-multithreaded-programming-with-the-new-c11-and-c11-standards", "length": "43:23", "likes": "5", "recorded": "2012-10-27", "short_description": "2011 Finally saw the publication of the new C11 and C++11 standards.
