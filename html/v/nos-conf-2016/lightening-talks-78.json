{"description": "Liquid File System (Sudharshan Karanth):\nNow a days we are using Virtual Machines in cloud environment because of simplified system maintenance and scalable resource management.The overhead is storing the virtual machine image.To address this issue, we use Liquid file system. Liquid, a Scalable deduplication filesystem.It is designed for storing the Virtual Machine Image storage and for the large scale Virtual Machine Deployment.It also provides other features like fast Virtual Machine cloning, on-demand fetching through network.\n\nAjax Crawler for Extracting Workflow of Web Applications in Python (Deepak Kushwaha) :\nModern Web Applications are very rich. Several techniques like Ajax are used. Traditional crawlers which scraps the content based on unique URLs are no more usable. Crawljax is one of the existing crawler which is being capable of crawling Web Applications with AJAX content. It is developed in Java. We have worked on similar lines as Crawljax and developed our own Ajax Crawler in Python using Selenium Python, Networkx,Beautiful Soup, matplotlib, xml, html parsers and other open source libraries for comparing HTML DOM tree. Our Crawler also produces State Workflow diagram at the end of Crawling Process. \n\nLinks:\nhttp://nosconf.github.io/", "event": {"name": "NOS - Nitte Open Source Conference 2016", "nickname": "nos-conf-2016", "twitter": "nosconf", "url": "http://nosconf.github.io/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "lightening-talks-78", "length": "35:57", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-03-18", "short_description": "Liquid File System (Sudharshan Karanth): Now a days we are using Virtual Machines in cloud environment because of simplified sys", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H-ina7CNKoU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Lightening Talks 7/8", "tweet_video": "Lightening%20Talks%207/8%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/nos-conf-2016/lightening-talks-78%20presented%20%40nosconf", "videos": [{"code": "H-ina7CNKoU", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "20"}
