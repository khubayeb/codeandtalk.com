{"description": "A discussion of the new graphics API & its impact on open-source software. OpenGL has done amazingly well over the last 24 years! Vulkan is the next big step in graphics programming and first implementations will be released soon by GPU makers like NVIDIA or AMD. It is redesigned from the ground-up targeting modern GPUs and software; It is not OpenGL++. Vulkan provides opportunities for education. It has a sharper learning curve & its object model matches hardware better. It provides several opportunities.\n\nLinks:\nhttp://nosconf.github.io/", "event": {"name": "NOS - Nitte Open Source Conference 2016", "nickname": "nos-conf-2016", "twitter": "nosconf", "url": "http://nosconf.github.io/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "future-of-graphics-in-open-source-hemanth-k", "length": "47:34", "likes": "3", "recorded": "2016-03-18", "short_description": "A discussion of the new graphics API & its impact on open-source software.
