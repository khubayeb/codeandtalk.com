{"description": "Modern software needs to be highly responsive, fast and also optimally utilizes the hardware resources,\nespecially CPU and memory, on which it runs. Therefore its not just enough to do parallel computations, but also\nto show high level concurrency. This presentation will explain concepts of concurrency, parallelism and how this\ncan be achieved in popular system languages like C, C++. Also this talk will show how modern languages like\nGO come with off-the-box features for the above\n\nLinks:\nhttp://nosconf.github.io/", "event": {"name": "NOS - Nitte Open Source Conference 2016", "nickname": "nos-conf-2016", "twitter": "nosconf", "url": "http://nosconf.github.io/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "concurrent-is-not-parallel-joseph-elwin-fernandes", "length": "37:45", "likes": "2", "recorded": "2016-03-18", "short_description": "Modern software needs to be highly responsive, fast and also optimally utilizes the hardware resources, especially CPU and memor", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {"joseph-elwin-fernandes": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"name": "Joseph Elwin Fernandes"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "NOS - Nitte Open Source Conference 2016", "nickname": "nos-conf-2016", "twitter": "nosconf", "url": "http://nosconf.github.io/"}, "filename": "concurrent-is-not-parallel-joseph-elwin-fernandes", "recorded": "2016-03-18", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rE1p3szuw0g/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Concurrent is NOT Parallel!"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rE1p3szuw0g/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Concurrent is NOT Parallel!", "tweet_video": "Concurrent%20is%20NOT%20Parallel%21%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/nos-conf-2016/concurrent-is-not-parallel-joseph-elwin-fernandes%20presented%20%40nosconf", "videos": [{"code": "rE1p3szuw0g", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "89"}
