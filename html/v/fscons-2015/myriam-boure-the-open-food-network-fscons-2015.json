But it's hard to build and organize a community, and you need tools to be able to buy as a group. The idea of the Open Food Network project is: what if instead of each community having to find, pay for, customize, a licensed solution, we could all mutualize our energies and money to build a platform that will answer the needs of all our communities, and make it easier for the next communities to start in order to scale up the emergence of this new distribution system?\n\nDownload video: https://fscons.org/videos", "event": {"name": "FSCONS 2015", "nickname": "fscons-2015", "twitter": "fscons", "url": "https://fscons.org/2015/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "myriam-boure-the-open-food-network-fscons-2015", "length": "54:35", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2015-11-07", "short_description": "Food distribution systems are not transparent: Where does the food you buy in the supermarket come from?
