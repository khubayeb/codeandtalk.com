{"abstract": "http://www.t-dose.org/2013/talks/scaling-cloud", "description": "Some people use the cloud. Others build one. This talk will be about building your own enteprise cloud.\nWhen running a cloud 3 things are important: scaling, easy (cost effective) maintenance, and stability. These 3 points are very closely related through one subject: automation. Thanks to the easy automation tools like pxe boot (for booting a new setup) and puppet (for configuring a new system) setting up a new server was never this easy. But how can we use these tools to create a scalable infrastructure that is cost effective, stable and easy to maintain?\nIn this talk you will learn about how to design a scalable secure architecture and how to make the right tools work for you without going into to much detail.", "event": {"name": "T-DOSE 2013", "nickname": "t-dose-2013", "twitter": "TDOSE", "url": "http://www.t-dose.org/2013/schedule"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "t-dose-2013-open-source-bert-desmet-scaling-the-cloud", "length": "31:34", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2013-10-26", "short_description": "Some people use the cloud.
