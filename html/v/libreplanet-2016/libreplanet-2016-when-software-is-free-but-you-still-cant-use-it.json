We need an easy and understood way of bringing the freedoms the GPL ensures to this third leg of intellectual property law.\n\nThis talk, by Collabora's Neil McGovern, sets out the background and problems with trademark implementation, how it's being (mis)used, and thoughts for what we need in the future.", "event": {"name": "LibrePlanet 2016", "nickname": "libreplanet-2016", "twitter": "", "url": "https://libreplanet.org/2016/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-26", "filename": "libreplanet-2016-when-software-is-free-but-you-still-cant-use-it", "length": "24:57", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-03-19", "short_description": "Patents, copyright and trademarks are sometimes conflated, and can all limit your freedoms to control your computing and lives.
