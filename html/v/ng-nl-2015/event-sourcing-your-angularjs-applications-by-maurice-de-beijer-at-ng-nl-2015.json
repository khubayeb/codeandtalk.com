{"description": "Most AngularJS applications just store the data being edited as is in a database. While it is perfectly fine to treat data in a simple CRUD fashion like this with a smaller application this is not very optimal when applications get more complex. For more complex applications using the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) design pattern together with Event-Sourcing (ES) is a much more powerful solution. With Event-Sourcing every action leading up to the current state is stored as a separate domain event. This collection of domain events is then used as the write model in the CQRS model. These same events are projected out to a secondary database to build the read model for the application. In this session Maurice de Beijer will explain why you might want to use Event-Sourcing and how to get started with this design in your AngularJS applications.\n\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/mauricedb/event-sourcing-your-angularjs-applications", "event": {"name": "NG-NL 2015", "nickname": "ng-nl-2015", "twitter": "ngnlconf", "url": "http://www.ng-nl.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2017-01-04", "filename": "event-sourcing-your-angularjs-applications-by-maurice-de-beijer-at-ng-nl-2015", "length": "22:43", "likes": "8", "recorded": "2015-02-13", "short_description": "Most AngularJS applications just store the data being edited as is in a database.
