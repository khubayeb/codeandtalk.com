{"description": "Phones and other battery powered devices require a more restricted application lifecycle to ensure that they can achieve low power states more often, even suspending regularly, in order to achieve the user expected battery life. Ubuntu Phone has a well defined application lifecycle that it presents to applications in order to ensure a good user experience for the end user. This talk would discuss the application lifecycle, what it means from both the user and the developers perspective. Attendees of the talk would come away with a better understanding of how their Ubuntu Phones work whether they're just using them or developing for them.", "event": {"name": "Texas LinuxFest 2015", "nickname": "texaslinuxfest-2015", "twitter": "texaslinuxfest", "url": "http://2015.texaslinuxfest.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "tx-linux-fest-2015-ted-gould-ubuntu-phone-application-lifecycle", "length": "28:31", "likes": "14", "recorded": "2015-08-21", "short_description": "Phones and other battery powered devices require a more restricted application lifecycle to ensure that they can achieve low pow", "speaker_twitters": " @tedjgould", "speakers": {"ted-gould": {"episodes": [{"date": "2009-07-04", "ep": "76", "guests": {"jon-a-cruz": {}, "ted-gould": {}}, "hosts": {"aaron-newcomb": {}, "randal-schwartz": {}}, "keywords": [], "permalink": "https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly/episodes/76", "source": "floss-weekly", "title": "Inkscape"}], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "TX, USA", "github": "ted-gould", "home": "http://gould.cx/ted/", "name": "Ted Gould", "twitter": "tedjgould"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Texas LinuxFest 2015", "nickname": "texaslinuxfest-2015", "twitter": "texaslinuxfest", "url": "http://2015.texaslinuxfest.org/"}, "filename": "tx-linux-fest-2015-ted-gould-ubuntu-phone-application-lifecycle", "recorded": "2015-08-21", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v5iY2NgaBeY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Ubuntu Phone: Application Lifecycle"}]}}, "tags": [{"link": "ubuntu", "text": "Ubuntu"}, {"link": "mobile", "text": "mobile"}], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v5iY2NgaBeY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Ubuntu Phone: Application Lifecycle", "tweet_video": "Ubuntu%20Phone%3A%20Application%20Lifecycle%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/texaslinuxfest-2015/tx-linux-fest-2015-ted-gould-ubuntu-phone-application-lifecycle%20presented%20%40texaslinuxfest%20by%20%40tedjgould%20%23ubuntu%20%23mobile", "videos": [{"code": "v5iY2NgaBeY", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "724"}
