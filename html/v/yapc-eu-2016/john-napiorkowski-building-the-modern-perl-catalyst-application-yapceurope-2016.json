Its also been around for a while (its in its 10th year!) and the current tutorials, books and various online documentation don't make it easy to see the distilled wisdom of the ages.

We'll also sketch out some ideas about what's next for Catalyst users, and talk about the cutting edge of web development using web sockets and related persistent protocols and we and thoughts about a Catalyst component based architecture.", "event": {"name": "YAPC - European Perl Conference 2016", "nickname": "yapc-eu-2016", "twitter": "yapceu", "url": "http://act.yapc.eu/ye2016/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "john-napiorkowski-building-the-modern-perl-catalyst-application-yapceurope-2016", "length": "01:22:40", "likes": "2", "recorded": "2016-08-24", "short_description": "Perl Catalyst is a modern, MVC (model-view-controller) development framework for building the server side of your web applicatio", "speaker_twitters": " @jjn1056", "speakers": {"john-napiorkowski": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"city": "Austin", "country": "USA", "github": "jjn1056", "name": "John Napiorkowski", "nickname": "jnap", "state": "TX", "twitter": "jjn1056"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "YAPC - European Perl Conference 2016", "nickname": "yapc-eu-2016", "twitter": "yapceu", "url": "http://act.yapc.eu/ye2016/"}, "filename": "john-napiorkowski-building-the-modern-perl-catalyst-application-yapceurope-2016", "recorded": "2016-08-24", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xmc95QJW8nU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Building the Modern Perl Catalyst Application"}, {"event": {"name": "YAPC - European Perl Conference 2016", "nickname": "yapc-eu-2016", "twitter": "yapceu", "url": "http://act.yapc.eu/ye2016/"}, "filename": "john-napiorkowski-perl-catalyst-design-pattern-deep-dive-yapceurope-2016", "recorded": "2016-08-24", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l-vSQOozboY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Perl Catalyst Design Pattern Deep Dive"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xmc95QJW8nU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Building the Modern Perl Catalyst Application", "tweet_video": "Building%20the%20Modern%20Perl%20Catalyst%20Application%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/yapc-eu-2016/john-napiorkowski-building-the-modern-perl-catalyst-application-yapceurope-2016%20presented%20%40yapceu%20by%20%40jjn1056", "videos": [{"code": "Xmc95QJW8nU", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "138"}
