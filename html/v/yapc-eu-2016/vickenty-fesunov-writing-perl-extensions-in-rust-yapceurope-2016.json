{"abstract": "http://act.yapc.eu/ye2016/talk/6856", "description": "Writing an extension module for Perl in C is tricky: it is easy to make a mistake that makes the interpreter catch fire and crash. XS API also adds its share of complexity.\n\nRust is a new programming language that has a strong focus on memory safety \u2014 preventing bugs that cause memory corruption and segfaults. It has thin runtime and can produce C-compatible shared libraries, which makes it suitable for embedding into other programs.\n\nRust expressive type system, macros, and standard library make it possible to abstract away many low-level details of XS API. The result is safer and more friendly API for extending Perl.", "event": {"name": "YAPC - European Perl Conference 2016", "nickname": "yapc-eu-2016", "twitter": "yapceu", "url": "http://act.yapc.eu/ye2016/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "vickenty-fesunov-writing-perl-extensions-in-rust-yapceurope-2016", "length": "21:38", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-08-24", "short_description": "Writing an extension module for Perl in C is tricky: it is easy to make a mistake that makes the interpreter catch fire and cras", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {"vickenty-fesunov": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "The Netherlands", "github": "vickenty", "name": "Vickenty Fesunov"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "YAPC - European Perl Conference 2016", "nickname": "yapc-eu-2016", "twitter": "yapceu", "url": "http://act.yapc.eu/ye2016/"}, "filename": "vickenty-fesunov-writing-perl-extensions-in-rust-yapceurope-2016", "recorded": "2016-08-24", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EZfm5rEnqBc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Writing Perl extensions in Rust"}, {"event": {"name": "YAPC::NA 2016", "nickname": "yapc-na-2016", "twitter": "yapcna", "url": "http://www.yapcna.org/yn2016/"}, "filename": "2016-writing-perl-extensions-in-rust-vickenty-fesunov", "recorded": "2016-06-20", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GwS8eDOYz_U/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Writing Perl extensions in Rust"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EZfm5rEnqBc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Writing Perl extensions in Rust", "tweet_video": "Writing%20Perl%20extensions%20in%20Rust%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/yapc-eu-2016/vickenty-fesunov-writing-perl-extensions-in-rust-yapceurope-2016%20presented%20%40yapceu", "videos": [{"code": "EZfm5rEnqBc", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "58"}
