Even though Ruby is an object-oriented language there are many beautiful concepts in functional programming that we can borrow and successfully apply in our Ruby code.\n\nIn this talk I\u2019ll show you how I mix FP with OO. I\u2019ll introduce you to functional objects, explain the beauty of Proc-like behavior, the power of call method and explain why immutability matters.\n\nhttp://fullstackfest.com/agenda/blending-functional-and-oo-programming-in-ruby\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)", "event": {"name": "Fullstack Fest 2015", "nickname": "fullstackfest-2015", "twitter": "fullstackfest", "url": "http://2015.fullstackfest.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "full-stack-fest-2015-blending-functional-and-oo-programming-in-ruby-by-piotr-solnica", "length": "25:49", "likes": "90", "recorded": "2015-09-01", "short_description": "Functional programming is being revitalized thanks to languages like Clojure, Haskell and Elixir.
