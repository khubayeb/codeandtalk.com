{"abstract": "http://2015.fullstackfest.com/agenda/extreme-object-oriented-ruby", "description": "I recently saw the talk \u2018Nothing is Something\u2019 by Sandi Metz and something caught my eye - the idea that Ruby doesn\u2019t need the \u2018if\u2019 keyword. This got me thinking: what else could we remove from the language without making it less powerful? In this talk I take this idea and push it to breaking point. Along the way we\u2019ll learn a lot about expressiveness, the limits of computation, the nature of programming and why we shouldn\u2019t try to create pure OO languages.\n\nhttp://fullstackfest.com/agenda/extreme-object-oriented-ruby\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)", "event": {"name": "Fullstack Fest 2015", "nickname": "fullstackfest-2015", "twitter": "fullstackfest", "url": "http://2015.fullstackfest.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "full-stack-fest-2015-extreme-object-oriented-ruby-by-john-cinnamond", "length": "47:24", "likes": "41", "recorded": "2015-09-01", "short_description": "I recently saw the talk \u2018Nothing is Something\u2019 by Sandi Metz and something caught my eye - the idea that Ruby doesn\u2019t need the \u2018", "speaker_twitters": " @jcinnamond", "speakers": {"john-cinnamond": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Tunbridge Wells, UK", "github": "jcinnamond", "home": "http://panagile.com/", "name": "John Cinnamond", "twitter": "jcinnamond"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Fullstack Fest 2015", "nickname": "fullstackfest-2015", "twitter": "fullstackfest", "url": "http://2015.fullstackfest.com/"}, "filename": "full-stack-fest-2015-extreme-object-oriented-ruby-by-john-cinnamond", "recorded": "2015-09-01", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FDs-sSxo2iY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Extreme Object-Oriented Ruby"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FDs-sSxo2iY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Extreme Object-Oriented Ruby", "tweet_video": "Extreme%20Object-Oriented%20Ruby%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/fullstackfest-2015/full-stack-fest-2015-extreme-object-oriented-ruby-by-john-cinnamond%20presented%20%40fullstackfest%20by%20%40jcinnamond", "videos": [{"code": "FDs-sSxo2iY", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "3056"}
