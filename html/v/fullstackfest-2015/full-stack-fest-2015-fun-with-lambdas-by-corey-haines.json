But how much have you played with it? In this talk, armed only with Vim and the CLI, we\u2019ll explore some interesting topics in building up our world with just the lambda and the thought process while doing it. While you probably don\u2019t want to program day-to-day at this level, it definitely can help with how you think about your regular programming. This talk consists almost entirely of live coding.
