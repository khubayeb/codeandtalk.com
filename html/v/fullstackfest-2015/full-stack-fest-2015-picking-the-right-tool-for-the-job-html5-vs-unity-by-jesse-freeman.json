If you are looking to build true cross platform games there are two great options, HTML5 and Unity, but choosing which one to start with can be difficult. In this talk we will discuss the pros and cons of each platform by looking at the same game built in Phaser (http://phaser.io) and Unity. We\u2019ll also discuss publishing options for both platforms and how to create truly cross platform games from a single codebase.\n\nhttp://fullstackfest.com/agenda/picking-the-right-tool-for-the-job-html5-vs-unity\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)", "event": {"name": "Fullstack Fest 2015", "nickname": "fullstackfest-2015", "twitter": "fullstackfest", "url": "http://2015.fullstackfest.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "full-stack-fest-2015-picking-the-right-tool-for-the-job-html5-vs-unity-by-jesse-freeman", "length": "37:21", "likes": "3", "recorded": "2015-09-01", "short_description": "Game developers have lots of options when it comes to picking platforms and frameworks to build their games with.
