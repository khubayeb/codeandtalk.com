{"blasters": ["devops"], "description": "There are two sides to monitoring - exposing problems with alerts and acting upon those alerts to find solutions to the exposed problem.\nFor exposing problems, users can define any script for <a href=\"https://www.consul.io/\">Consul</a> to intelligently check and report the health status of all nodes in a cluster.\nThese scripts could be as simple as returning a 200, or as complex as querying the load and query response time on a database server.\nOther monitoring solutions already provide such functionality, but where Consul shines is in the second half of monitoring - automatic intervention to find solutions to problems without human operators.\n<p>\nSince Consul has built-in health checking, it not only notifies operators of a node or service failure, but automatically routes traffic away from unhealthy nodes.\nConsul is also able to re-route traffic back to a troubled node, once the node reports it is healthy again.\nIn this way Consul pushes the existing paradigms of monitoring, making it much more than a simple notification system.\nRather it surfaces problems and solves them without human intervention. Don't worry about that pager going off in the middle of the night - rest easy with Consul.\n<p>\nThis talk will cover many of the high-level features of Consul as they relate to monitoring. While this talk may seem deeply technical on the surface, it is aimed at a very large audience.\nI will not discuss setup or installation of Consul, but I will demonstrate the Consul Web UI and command line.\nThere will be some commands/code on slides, but there will be no live demos.\n<p>\nOne of the goals of this talk is to demonstrate the Consul is more than a traditional monitoring solution - it is a runtime for the modern datacenter.\nConsul allows infrastructure to adapt to the changing needs of any environment.\",\n\nChallenges in SOA - Service Oriented Architectures:\n<ul>\n  <li>Autonomous</li>\n  <li>Limited Scope</li>\n  <li>Loose Coupling</li>\n</ul>\n\n<q>How does the web app tell the order processing that there is a new order?</q>\n<ul>\n  <li>A Service discovery problem.</li>\n  <li>Load balancing problem.</li>\n  <li>Healt checking: <q>How to avoid sending processes to unhealthy nodes?</q></li>\n  <li>Key-Value configuration: <q>How to update a server without taking down the whole system?</q> (tune feature flags)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Existing (partial) solutions</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://zookeeper.apache.org/\">Zookeeper</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://coreos.com/etcd/\">ETCD</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://sensuapp.org/\">Sensu</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://nerds.airbnb.com/smartstack-service-discovery-cloud/\">Smart Stack</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n   <li>Service discovery: HTTP  and DNS API (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_(command)\">dig</a>)</li>\n   <li></li>\n</ul>\n\nSpeaker is director of evangelism at <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/\">Hashicorp</a>.\n", "event": {"name": "DevCon Tel Aviv 2016.03", "nickname": "devcon-telaviv-2016-03", "twitter": "fogelmania", "url": "https://devcontlv-march2016.events.co.il/home"}, "favorite": "0", "featured": "2016-12-15", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "consul-as-a-monitoring-service-seth-vargo-at-devcontlv-march-2016", "length": "25:47", "likes": "12", "recorded": "2016-03-22", "short_description": "There are two sides to monitoring - exposing problems with alerts and acting upon those alerts to find solutions to the exposed ", "speaker_twitters": " @sethvargo", "speakers": {"seth-vargo": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Pittsburgh, PA, USA", "github": "sethvargo", "home": "https://sethvargo.com/", "name": "Seth Vargo", "twitter": "sethvargo"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "All Things Open 2015", "nickname": "allthingsopen-2015", "twitter": "AllThingsOpen", "url": "https://allthingsopen.org/2015"}, "filename": "all-things-open-2015-seth-vargo-hashicorp-vagrant-101-development-environments", "recorded": "2015-10-19", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M19V1TzR0cc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "HashiCorp | Vagrant 101: Development Environments"}, {"event": {"name": "DevCon Tel Aviv 2016.03", "nickname": "devcon-telaviv-2016-03", "twitter": "fogelmania", "url": "https://devcontlv-march2016.events.co.il/home"}, "filename": "consul-as-a-monitoring-service-seth-vargo-at-devcontlv-march-2016", "recorded": "2016-03-22", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UK3EFUcS-Ps/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Consul as a Monitoring Service"}, {"event": {"name": "GOTO Stockholm 2016", "nickname": "gotocon-stockholm-2016", "twitter": "gotosthlm", "url": "https://gotosthlm.com/"}, "filename": "goto-2016-nomad-scheduling-applications-at-scale-seth-vargo", "recorded": "2016-05-09", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hllS4Gutams/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Nomad: Scheduling Applications at Scale"}]}}, "tags": [{"link": "consule", "text": "consule"}, {"link": "soa", "text": "soa"}], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UK3EFUcS-Ps/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Consul as a Monitoring Service", "tweet_video": "Consul%20as%20a%20Monitoring%20Service%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/devcon-telaviv-2016-03/consul-as-a-monitoring-service-seth-vargo-at-devcontlv-march-2016%20presented%20%40fogelmania%20by%20%40sethvargo%20%23consule%20%23soa", "videos": [{"code": "UK3EFUcS-Ps", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "838"}
