{"description": "Currently there are ES7 features proposed for async programming that have never been seen in a programming language before. If accepted, these proposals could allow entire JS applications to be written without a single callback! By providing the same level of support for async functions as regular functions, ES7 could dramatically alter the way everyday developers write code. Imagine reading data from a stream or a web socket with a simple loop. Imagine catching async errors using try/catch, and never again finding yourself in the callback pyramid of doom.\n\nTranscript: https://gist.github.com/voodootikigod/74935e99334367e2c09c", "event": {"name": "JSConf USA 2015", "nickname": "jsconf-us-2015", "twitter": "jsconf", "url": "http://2015.jsconf.us/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "jafar-husain-async-programming-in-es7-jsconf-us-2015", "length": "32:57", "likes": "481", "recorded": "2015-05-27", "short_description": "Currently there are ES7 features proposed for async programming that have never been seen in a programming language before.
