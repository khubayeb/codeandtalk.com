{"description": "The formula for a Bezier curve is beautiful. Using sine and cosine to create orbiting objects is dazzling. L-systems create fractals through elegant simplicity. Developers, as a group, may be losing site of the beauty that code can create. Designers by the bunch are picking up a keyboard and creating amazing pieces, but it's happening the other way very slowly. That's a shame, because the computer lets otherwise unexpressed ideas go unexplored. Developers have the ability to embrace the art of programming and the art of art because of the myriad frameworks available. Use the language of your choice to make some art, whether it\u2019s in the browser or in the physical realm. Walk away with the confidence and the inspiration to put down the work for a minute and pick up a digital paintbrush.\n\nTranscript: https://gist.github.com/voodootikigod/3bb0e6fc1d03189e5274", "event": {"name": "JSConf USA 2015", "nickname": "jsconf-us-2015", "twitter": "jsconf", "url": "http://2015.jsconf.us/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "john-brown-math-art-art-code-jsconf-us-2015", "length": "27:00", "likes": "37", "recorded": "2015-05-27", "short_description": "The formula for a Bezier curve is beautiful.
