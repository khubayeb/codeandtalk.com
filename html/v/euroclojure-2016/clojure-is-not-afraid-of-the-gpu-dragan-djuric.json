{"description": "Today's hot topics, data science and machine learning, offer many algorithms that can turn lifeless data into useful information. Based on math-heavy theory, relying on number crunching, often billions and billions of raw operations must be performed quickly. Clojure can be teamed up with hardware accelerators or GPUs to offer both a cozy dynamic REPL environment and the speed and power of low-level hardware optimizations for numerical computations. In this talk, I present a few libraries tailored by the Clojure's measure, that can help achieve state-of-the-art performance: ClojureCL to direct the GPU, Neanderthal to help with vectorization and linear algebra, and Bayadera's incredibly fast MCMC engine. Clojure may not be able to compete with R and Python in the off-the-shelf machine learning, but for high-performance customized algorithms - it can be THE secret sauce.", "event": {"name": "Euro Clojure 2016", "nickname": "euroclojure-2016", "twitter": "EuroClojure", "url": "http://euroclojure.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "clojure-is-not-afraid-of-the-gpu-dragan-djuric", "length": "42:13", "likes": 0, "recorded": "2016-10-25", "short_description": "Today's hot topics, data science and machine learning, offer many algorithms that can turn lifeless data into useful information", "speaker_twitters": " @uncomplicateorg", "speakers": {"dragan-djuric": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"github": "blueberry", "home": "http://dragan.rocks/", "name": "Dragan Djuric", "twitter": "uncomplicateorg"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Euro Clojure 2016", "nickname": "euroclojure-2016", "twitter": "EuroClojure", "url": "http://euroclojure.org/"}, "filename": "clojure-is-not-afraid-of-the-gpu-dragan-djuric", "recorded": "2016-10-25", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bEOOYbscyTs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Clojure is Not Afraid of the GPU"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bEOOYbscyTs/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Clojure is Not Afraid of the GPU", "tweet_video": "Clojure%20is%20Not%20Afraid%20of%20the%20GPU%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/euroclojure-2016/clojure-is-not-afraid-of-the-gpu-dragan-djuric%20presented%20%40EuroClojure%20by%20%40uncomplicateorg", "videos": [{"code": "bEOOYbscyTs", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "1969"}
