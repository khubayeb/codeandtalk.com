{"description": "Rachel Andrew is a CSS Grid Layout module superfan. It's the layout method she\u2019s been waiting for ever since she started dabbling in CSS for layout in the late 90s. Having tracked development of the module from the early days of the IE10 implementation, she is very excited to see it come to life in Chrome. In this talk Rachel will show you how Grid Layout works, and explain why you should become a fan of Grid Layout too.\n\nRACHEL ANDREW\n\nRachel is a web developer, speaker, writer and Managing Director over at edgeofmyseat.com. She has authored books on CSS and web design, and just released her latest book, The Profitable Side Project Handbook.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/rachelandrew\nhttp://www.rachelandrew.co.uk/", "event": {"name": "CSSConf EU 2014", "nickname": "cssconf-eu-2014", "twitter": "cssconfeu", "url": "http://2014.cssconf.eu/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-31", "filename": "cssconf-eu-2014-rachel-andrew-css-grid-layout", "length": "28:57", "likes": "136", "recorded": "2014-09-12", "short_description": "Rachel Andrew is a CSS Grid Layout module superfan.
