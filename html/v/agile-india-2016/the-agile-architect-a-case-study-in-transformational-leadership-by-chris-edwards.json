{"abstract": "https://confengine.com/agile-india-2016/proposal/1796", "description": "The role of \u201cArchitect\u201d is sometimes frowned upon in the Agile community as a central command-and-control authority who bottlenecks decisions and limits team empowerment. Or at least, that is what we thought. Follow the real-life journey of our teams as we discovered how the role of an architect is compatible with Agile principles. We will explore our failures, and how we learned that an Architect can bring immense value to the organization through a focus on transformational leadership. In this presentation you can see how an Architect as Leader can help a project scale and can help create a truly self-sustaining organization.", "event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "the-agile-architect-a-case-study-in-transformational-leadership-by-chris-edwards", "length": "43:31", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "short_description": "The role of \u201cArchitect\u201d is sometimes frowned upon in the Agile community as a central command-and-control authority who bottlene", "speaker_twitters": " @chrisedwardsuk", "speakers": {"chris-edwards": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Canada", "home": "http://chrisedwardsuk.blogspot.com/", "name": "Chris Edwards", "twitter": "chrisedwardsuk"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "filename": "7-sins-of-scrum-and-other-agile-antipatterns-by-sean-dunn-chris-edwards", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FghQVc747Z4/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "7 Sins of Scrum and other Agile Antipatterns"}, {"event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "filename": "the-agile-architect-a-case-study-in-transformational-leadership-by-chris-edwards", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R2G9CFi9zsw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Agile Architect: A Case Study in Transformational Leadership"}, {"event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "filename": "the-value-uncertainty-game-by-chris-edwards-sean-dunn", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wwtqMkQ5LGc/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Value Uncertainty Game"}, {"event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "filename": "to-estimate-or-noestimates-that-is-the-question-by-sean-dunn-chris-edwards", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5Q_S5gnXPqY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "To Estimate or #NoEstimates, That is the Question"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R2G9CFi9zsw/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Agile Architect: A Case Study in Transformational Leadership", "tweet_video": "The%20Agile%20Architect%3A%20A%20Case%20Study%20in%20Transformational%20Leadership%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/agile-india-2016/the-agile-architect-a-case-study-in-transformational-leadership-by-chris-edwards%20presented%20%40agileindia%20by%20%40chrisedwardsuk", "videos": [{"code": "R2G9CFi9zsw", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "204"}
