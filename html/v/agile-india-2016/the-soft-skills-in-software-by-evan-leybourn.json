{"abstract": "https://confengine.com/agile-india-2016/proposal/1810", "description": "You\u2019re probably here at this conference because you want to become a better developer, but I\u2019m here to tell you that that you\u2019re focusing on the wrong area. The difference between a good programmer and a great one isn\u2019t the ability to write a kernel module in LISP, but the ability to communicate with your colleagues and customers. Skills sharing, collaboration and functional communication are critical for the success of any software project, and yet usually overlooked and undervalued.\n\nDevelopers who strive to be great, cannot afford to neglect their professional development in these areas. You don\u2019t to reinforce the dreadful stereotype of the shy, stuttering, geek, do you?\n\nThis interactive presentation will examine a few of the critical \u201csoft skills\u201d that are needed to thrive in corporate team environments. For example, how you can:\n\nwrite effectively and speak clearly; i.e. get to the point,\nmove beyond your technical silo to work effectively as a team,\nbuild trust and rapport with your project customers,\nmentor, motivate and encourage others,\nmediate or negotiate between competing points of view,\nlead others and manage vendors", "event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "the-soft-skills-in-software-by-evan-leybourn", "length": "01:11:48", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "short_description": "You\u2019re probably here at this conference because you want to become a better developer, but I\u2019m here to tell you that that you\u2019re", "speaker_twitters": " @eleybourn", "speakers": {"evan-leybourn": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Singapore", "github": "eleybourn", "home": "http://theagiledirector.com/", "name": "Evan Leybourn", "twitter": "eleybourn"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "filename": "if-you-need-to-start-a-project-youve-already-failed-noprojects-by-evan-leybourn", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TlX60wzr29Y/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "If you need to start a project, you\u2019ve already failed #noprojects"}, {"event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "filename": "the-soft-skills-in-software-by-evan-leybourn", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VS4ZQj4TQWA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Soft Skills in Software"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VS4ZQj4TQWA/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Soft Skills in Software", "tweet_video": "The%20Soft%20Skills%20in%20Software%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/agile-india-2016/the-soft-skills-in-software-by-evan-leybourn%20presented%20%40agileindia%20by%20%40eleybourn", "videos": [{"code": "VS4ZQj4TQWA", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "52"}
