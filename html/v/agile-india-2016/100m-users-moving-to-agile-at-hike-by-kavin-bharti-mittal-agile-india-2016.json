They created 4 squads.</li>\n  <li>The browser and the TAB has replaced the shrinkwrap applications on Desktop. On mobile we still install individual apps for everything.</li>\n  <li>Now they hae 250 in 12 squads</li>\n  <li>The problem with squads is that they optimize for local maximum. They don't communicate among themselves.</li>\n  <li>Chapters are horizontal group: Design chapter, Android Chapter.</li>\n  <li>Each chapter has weekly meetings talking about what they were building. That helps reduce duplication and increases cooperation between squads for code reuse and for APIs.</li>\n  <li>The PO of each squad is a mini-entrepreneur. The Chapter leader of each chapter is like a mini-professor.</li>\n  <li>Squaads themselves become siloed teams. Chapters solved the problem.</li>\n  <li>Teams need Autonomy and Alignment</li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.squadify.com/\">Squadify</a> ???</li>\n  <li>100 M+ users, 40B messages / month, 120 min / week inside the application</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Hike Core value (explained at 44:00)</h3>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Maniacal abour our <b>mission</b></li>\n  <li>Obsess to deliver <b>Wow</b></li>\n  <li>Solve for the <b>User first</b></li>\n  <li>Autonomy and <b>ownership</b></li>\n  <li>Obsess over <b>metrics</b></li>\n  <li>unreasonably high-bar on <b>people</b></li>\n  <li>Individual <b>mastery</b></li>\n  <li>Fierce sense of <b>urgency</b></li>\n  <li>Questions <b>Status Quo</b></li>\n  <li><b>Company</b> &gt; Team &gt; Self</li>\n  <li>Make memories and <b>have fun</b></li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><q>Intuition does not scale</q></li>\n    <li><q>How to validate the problem and solution in the cheapest way?
