There are well established organizations where the usage of Agile has been remarkable and Orbitz is one of those places.\nWhy don\u2019t we hear as much in the BI space when it comes to Agile? This is probably attributed to the ad-hoc nature of BI projects and fluid nature of End Goals. We over the last few years tried to change this perception and leverage the goodness and effectiveness of being Agile in the BI space. BI is so vast that there are different areas where you can bring in the principles and process of Agile. We are incorporating XP, Scrum and Kanban principles to transform the way we do development and support our businesses. We were also successful in incorporating CI within the BI area using tools such as Jenkins, Stash and Git.\nBroadly classifying the BI projects either into Migration or New Development, we could categorize the Characteristics and Challenges faced in BI projects in terms of Business Stakeholders, Budget, Team Composition, Know-How and Execution time. Based on these factors, identifying the right framework of Agile was the key. This helped in zeroing on tools, techniques, methods etc of Agile philosophy and enabled successful completion of projects.", "event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "is-bidwh-and-agile-an-oxymoron-by-raghu-anu", "length": "39:56", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "short_description": "Its been a long journey for Agile in Product Development or support areas.
