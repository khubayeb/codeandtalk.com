What stops us from really changing the world?\n\nIt's a truism that an inpidual can't beat the system, right? So how do we go about making change a collective agenda? How do we encourage leadership everywhere? We start by focusing on others rather than ourselves.\n\nIn this interactive session I lead a series of small activities that model how we can go from a discussion with our friend about how things should be to leading change across the organisation. \n\nI run three small discussions. Each one is designed to teach a method for increasing influence and effecting organisational change.  We pick the theme of \"When I saw someone do something great/amazing at work\" and each iteration we increase the number of people in the discussion, and make the stories more personal.\n\nThis shows how in just three iterations of a discussion we can totally change the way we interact with the environment (i.e. the people in the wider business) and drive braver conversations.", "event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "small-conversations-lead-to-big-change-by-craig-brown-at-agile-india-2016", "length": "23:25", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "short_description": "It's great to come to conferences and hear all the good advice from lost of smart and experienced people.
