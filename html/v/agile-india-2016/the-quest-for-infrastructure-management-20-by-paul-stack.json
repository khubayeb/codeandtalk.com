{"abstract": "https://confengine.com/agile-india-2016/proposal/1971", "description": "The age old task of racking and stacking in a physical data centre is becoming more and more rare as more companies embrace the public cloud. Having the ability to chose between providers such as AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean and Google Cloud Platform makes creating infrastructure easy. It is better to spend time developing better services for our customers than managing infrastructure\n \nDuring this talk, Paul will demonstrate how building a scalable infrastructure on AWS becomes easy with Terraform. The talk will demonstrate how using configuration management, pre-baked AMIs and auto-scaling groups it gives the ability for developers to be able to launch their own infrastructure when needed. The demo\u2019s will include the ability to launch instances, databases and manage user access\n \nBy the end of the talk, Paul will have demonstrated that the creation of infrastructure now becomes part of the development lifecycle and that the old ways of system administration is fast moving to become infrastructure engineering. Paul will also demonstrate that the creation of new \u2018environments\u2019 are just a change of parameters in our infrastructure code", "event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "the-quest-for-infrastructure-management-20-by-paul-stack", "length": "01:27:04", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "short_description": "The age old task of racking and stacking in a physical data centre is becoming more and more rare as more companies embrace the ", "speaker_twitters": " @stack72", "speakers": {"paul-stack": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "UK", "github": "stack72", "home": "http://www.paulstack.co.uk/", "name": "Paul Stack", "twitter": "stack72"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "filename": "the-quest-for-infrastructure-management-20-by-paul-stack", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X5LJRqozQ38/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Quest For Infrastructure Management 2.0"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X5LJRqozQ38/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Quest For Infrastructure Management 2.0", "tweet_video": "The%20Quest%20For%20Infrastructure%20Management%202.0%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/agile-india-2016/the-quest-for-infrastructure-management-20-by-paul-stack%20presented%20%40agileindia%20by%20%40stack72", "videos": [{"code": "X5LJRqozQ38", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "15"}
