No amount of industrial-strength job scheduling makes your organization immune to Conway\u2019s Law.\n\n \n\nDoes this mean that devops has failed? Not in the slightest. It means that while the unscrupulous might try to sell us devops, we can\u2019t buy it.

Containers prove to be a useful boundary object, and deconstructing systems to human-scale allows us to comprehend their complexity. We succeed when we share responsibility and have agency, when we move past learned helplessness to active listening. But there is no flowchart, no checklist, no shopping list of ticky boxes that will make everything better. \u201cAnyone who says differently is selling something\u201d, as The Princess Bride teaches us.\n\n\nPart rant, part devops therapy, this talk will explain in the nerdiest of terms why CAP theorem applies to human interactions too, how oral tradition is like never writing state to disk, and what we can do to avoid sadness as a service.", "event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "containers-will-not-fix-your-broken-culture-and-other-hard-truths-by-bridget-kromhout", "length": "42:33", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "short_description": "Containers will not fix your broken culture.
