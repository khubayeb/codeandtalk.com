{"abstract": "https://confengine.com/agile-india-2016/proposal/1884", "description": "Agile development isn\u2019t any longer considered to work for small teams only. Also large teams, projects and organizations are asked to focus on delivering value. So the question arises, how to adhere to the agile principles when applying them in the large.\n\nIn this workshop we want to use the agile principles as a guideline for scaling. This is basically by understanding agile as a value system, a mindset, a culture \u2013 and not as a tool. So be prepared to being asked to think for yourself and to balance forces based on your own needs and requirements instead of finding a recipe that assumes that one size will or can fit all (organizations, projects, products, or teams). Thus, this workshop is not about providing or defining a framework for the enterprise or the organization, scaling scrum or using other existing methodologies at different organizational levels. It is about examining the agile principles according to their effects and application when scaling up. For example, we will discuss what a principle such as \"self-organizing teams\" means when it is applied to a team of more than 100 developers or to the enterprise level.\n\nThe workshop is based on the necessity of large-scale Agile to give and get frequent feedback in order to deliver the highest business value to the customer at all times besides learning and getting better continuously.", "event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "scaling-agile-principle-by-jutta-eckstein", "length": "01:11:31", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "short_description": "Agile development isn\u2019t any longer considered to work for small teams only.
