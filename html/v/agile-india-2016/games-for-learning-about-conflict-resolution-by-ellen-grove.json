{"abstract": "https://confengine.com/agile-india-2016/proposal/1905", "description": "Scaling Agile across the enterprise can also scale up or create new organizational conflicts: groups that are accustomed to working in their own silos struggle to find ways to identify their shared interests and collaborate effectively.  Equipping team members with effective conflict resolution skills is important in helping everyone navigate change successfully.\n\nConflict isn\u2019t inherently a bad thing \u2013 it\u2019s inevitable when people are working closely together on things that they care about. In fact, diverging viewpoints can bring new insights to help teams move forward and create something new. Dealing with conflict head-on is challenging for many people, yet few organizations and teams spend time explicitly considering \u201chow will we work together when things get rocky?\u201d Teams need to build the skills to be able to navigate through rough times together and come out with win-win solutions.\n\nThis workshop will present useful models for considering conflict supported by games teams can use to develop and practice conflict resolution skills. The models address underlying drivers of conflict, modes for responding to conflict, assessing conflict severity to determine appropriate interventions, and the patterns of principled negotiation. The games build on the concepts to help participants gain insight and develop important skills in a non-intimidating and memorable way.", "event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "games-for-learning-about-conflict-resolution-by-ellen-grove", "length": "01:11:02", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "short_description": "Scaling Agile across the enterprise can also scale up or create new organizational conflicts: groups that are accustomed to work", "speaker_twitters": " @eegrove", "speakers": {"ellen-grove": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Canada", "home": "http://masteringtheobvious.wordpress.com/", "name": "Ellen Grove", "twitter": "eegrove"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "filename": "everything-is-better-when-we-stick-together-by-ellen-grove", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ONfFo6n2d-k/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Everything Is Better When We Stick Together"}, {"event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "filename": "games-for-learning-about-conflict-resolution-by-ellen-grove", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S921MpBry2U/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Games for Learning about Conflict Resolution"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S921MpBry2U/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Games for Learning about Conflict Resolution", "tweet_video": "Games%20for%20Learning%20about%20Conflict%20Resolution%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/agile-india-2016/games-for-learning-about-conflict-resolution-by-ellen-grove%20presented%20%40agileindia%20by%20%40eegrove", "videos": [{"code": "S921MpBry2U", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "78"}
