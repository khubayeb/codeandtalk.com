{"description": "CLEAN THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH MUSIC\n\nThe main vision of project \u201c Thaalavattam\u201d (A percussion based project) is to create music using innovative instruments made from waste plastic and metal (reduce. reuse and recycle). Thaalavattam aims to clean up the plastic waste that is plaguing India, through music. At the moment in India, Thaalavattam also conducts rhythm rush ( A drum circle event) through which we try to encourage people to recycle and re-use waste materials. Thaalavattam also has an interior designing space (where-in, Furniture is made from scrap)\nThis is a percussion-based project by Montry Manuel, which uses instruments created from waste plastic and metal with the aim to inspire people to think creatively about waste. His instruments are mainly created from reused paint cans, soda cans, PVC pipes etc. mimicking the street drummers. The basic ideology is that everyone can be a part of the circle.\n\nMore details: http://www.thaalavattam.in/about.html\n\nConference: http://2016.agileindia.org", "event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "thaalavattam-project-a-music-jam-session-with-100-instruments-at-agile-india-2016", "length": "01:29:49", "likes": "2", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "short_description": "CLEAN THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH MUSIC The main vision of project \u201c Thaalavattam\u201d (A percussion based project) is to create music u", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yTGxMLbgD3Q/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Thaalavattam Project - A Music Jam Session with 100 instruments at Agile India 2016", "tweet_video": "Thaalavattam%20Project%20-%20A%20Music%20Jam%20Session%20with%20100%20instruments%20at%20Agile%20India%202016%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/agile-india-2016/thaalavattam-project-a-music-jam-session-with-100-instruments-at-agile-india-2016%20presented%20%40agileindia", "videos": [{"code": "yTGxMLbgD3Q", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "187"}
