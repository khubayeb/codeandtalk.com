{"abstract": "https://confengine.com/agile-india-2016/proposal/1900/scaling-beyond-the-enterprise", "description": "The brilliance of early Agile methods was their non-conformity. They rejected conventional wisdom about how software should be created and substituted a new reality: one where collaboration, adaptation, and continuous improvement were more important than rigid processes and plans. At first, many people rejected these innovations, but Agile stood the test of time. Now it's won the day.\n\nWhen people talk about scaling Agile, they forget those insurrectionary roots. They focus on what's palatable to the \"enterprise:\" how to make Agile safe, non-threatening, and acceptable--how to make it more conventional and conformist. In doing so, they risk losing the innovations that make Agile work so well.\n\nWhat if we stopped worrying about what's safe and acceptable? What if we went back to those innovative roots? What would Agile look like if we scaled beyond the enterprise?", "event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "scaling-beyond-the-enterprise-by-james-shore-agile-india-2016", "length": "01:01:15", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "short_description": "The brilliance of early Agile methods was their non-conformity.
