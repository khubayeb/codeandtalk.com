How can you ease the process of creating and managing the right dockerfiles? How do you manage docker images? How do you orchestrate docker containers? How do you manage configurations across the different environments of dev, test and prod?\n<p>\nYou can use Chef to provision and configure the machines which will host docker containers.\nChef can create container images. \nChef can configure docker containers when they boot and while they run.\nChef can deploy, run and stop containers.\nMoreover chef can help you debug and analyse whats happening in your application that runs inside the docker container.\n<p>\nThis tutorial will run you through the way you can configure and manage Docker using Chef.\nIt will be supported with a demo and a real business case.\n\n", "event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "baking-docker-using-chef-mukta", "length": "01:12:55", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "short_description": "Docker wave has changed the way we look at infrastructure today.
