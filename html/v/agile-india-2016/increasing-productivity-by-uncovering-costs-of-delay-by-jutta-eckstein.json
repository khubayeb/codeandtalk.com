{"abstract": "https://confengine.com/agile-india-2016/proposal/1882", "description": "Fred Brooks once stated so wisely \"How does a project get to be a year late? \u2026 One day at a time.\" Lean Development and queuing theories offer help so that this won't happen. The suggested remedy is to implement a steady flow in order to achieve maximum productivity. However, most teams and organizations are far from reaching that goal and moreover it is often unclear which approach leads to what kind of delay. In-depth examination shows how generally accepted concepts such as Definition of Ready, Clean Code, or experts in a team can lead to costs of delay. In this session Jutta presents simple tools and methods for uncovering hidden costs of delay. These tools and methods can be applied in various contexts: In small and large teams as well as in co-located and distributed teams. Using an agile approach will help to make these cost visible.", "event": {"name": "Agile India 2016", "nickname": "agile-india-2016", "twitter": "agileindia", "url": "http://2016.agileindia.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "increasing-productivity-by-uncovering-costs-of-delay-by-jutta-eckstein", "length": "43:13", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-03-14", "short_description": "Fred Brooks once stated so wisely How does a project get to be a year late? \u2026 One day at a time.
