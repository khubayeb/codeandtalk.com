{"description": "Distributed systems are hard. om.next makes them simpler making state transfer and state transitions idiomatic. With synchronization out of the way a developer can finally focus on testing business logic. In this talk we will explore a lightweight method of property based testing for the business logic that spans client and server. Talk will include a demo using your favorite tools like om.next, component, datomic, test.check, and the reader conditional", "event": {"name": "Clojure West 2016", "nickname": "clojurewest-2016", "twitter": "ClojureWest", "url": "http://clojurewest.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "fast-full-stack-testing-in-omnext-jack-dubie", "length": "40:08", "likes": 0, "recorded": "2016-04-15", "short_description": "Distributed systems are hard. om.next makes them simpler making state transfer and state transitions idiomatic.
