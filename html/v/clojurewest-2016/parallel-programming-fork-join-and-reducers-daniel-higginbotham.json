{"description": "If you don't know your work/span from your fork/join, this talk is for you! By attending this introduction to \"thinking parallel,\" you'll learn why parallel programming matters, how to think about performance, and how to tackle real-world concerns. You'll learn about how the fork/join framework embodies best practices. And of course, you'll learn how Clojure implements these ideas with reducers.", "event": {"name": "Clojure West 2016", "nickname": "clojurewest-2016", "twitter": "ClojureWest", "url": "http://clojurewest.org/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-10", "filename": "parallel-programming-fork-join-and-reducers-daniel-higginbotham", "length": "40:54", "likes": 0, "recorded": "2016-04-15", "short_description": "If you don't know your work/span from your fork/join, this talk is for you!
