Over the decades, the parallelism at the core of the notation has been extended, to nested arrays in the 80's and arrays of objects in the 00's. In this decade, arrays of futures have been added to provide users of APL with the ability to express asynchronous \\u2013 but deterministic -algorithms.\n<p>\nThis talk will introduce the most important parallel constructs available in current Dyalog APL, which (despite the name) essentially remains an executable mathematical notation.\n\n", "event": {"name": "Functional Conf 2016", "nickname": "functionalconf-2016", "twitter": "fnConf", "url": "http://functionalconf.com/2016/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "notation-for-parallel-thought-by-morten-kromberg-at-functional-conf-16", "length": "52:44", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-10-13", "short_description": "Since the original APL\\360 interpreter saw the light of day in 1966, a large part of the of primitive functions in APL (A Progra", "speaker_twitters": " @mkromberg", "speakers": {"morten-kromberg": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Denmark", "github": "mkromberg", "home": "http://dyalog.com/", "name": "Morten Kromberg", "twitter": "mkromberg"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Functional Conf 2016", "nickname": "functionalconf-2016", "twitter": "fnConf", "url": "http://functionalconf.com/2016/"}, "filename": "notation-for-parallel-thought-by-morten-kromberg-at-functional-conf-16", "recorded": "2016-10-13", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-erRtkugsRY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Notation for Parallel Thought"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-erRtkugsRY/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Notation for Parallel Thought", "tweet_video": "Notation%20for%20Parallel%20Thought%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/functionalconf-2016/notation-for-parallel-thought-by-morten-kromberg-at-functional-conf-16%20presented%20%40fnConf%20by%20%40mkromberg", "videos": [{"code": "-erRtkugsRY", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "57"}
