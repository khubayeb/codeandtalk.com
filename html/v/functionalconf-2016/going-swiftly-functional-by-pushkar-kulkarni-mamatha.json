{"abstract": "https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2016/proposal/2929", "description": "Two years after its introduction, the Swift programming language finds itself at rank # 14 on the TIOBE index for July 2016.\nSome of the prime reasons for Swift's meteoric rise are its carefully designed syntax and semantics - it borrows heavily from the best features of a wide range of languages.\nThe syntax is intuitive and new Swift learners can often relate it to the language of their choice.\nIntroduced primarily as a client-side language, Swift was open sourced in December 2015 via swift.org.\nSince then, there has been a community effort on extending its capabilities to the server side too.\nSwift is available on Linux today, and it is poised to become a language enabling end to end development - from mobile apps to server backends.\n<p>\nSwift falls in the category of \"modern native languages\" - like Rust and Go.\nThese runtimes run code in bare metal, boosting performance.\nThey are statically, strongly typed and with type-inference.\nThis makes them safe.\nTheir modern syntax also makes them expressive enough for high level abstractions like those seen in functional programming.\nThey try to solve some of the tradeoffs that languages of the past battled with.\nOn the other hand, functional programming has found new oxygen in the last couple of years when agile methodologies become as pervasive as multicore hardware.\nWhile we do have languages like Haskell that are purely functional and provide excellent support to express functional concepts, it is important to separate functional thinking away from the language.\nFunctional programming is supported by most of the languages today because the returns of it in terms of expression, conciseness, readability, correctness and performance are unmatched.\nSwift is not a purely functional language.\nHowever, it provides syntactic and semantic support for functional programming to a large extent.\n\n", "event": {"name": "Functional Conf 2016", "nickname": "functionalconf-2016", "twitter": "fnConf", "url": "http://functionalconf.com/2016/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "going-swiftly-functional-by-pushkar-kulkarni-mamatha", "length": "01:37:08", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-10-13", "short_description": "Two years after its introduction, the Swift programming language finds itself at rank # 14 on the TIOBE index for July 2016.
