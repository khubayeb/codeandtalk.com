{"abstract": "https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2016/proposal/2939", "description": "Homoiconicity (code as data, data as code) is one of the hallmarks of Lisp. Clojure, a Lisp-1 language, has this wonderful feature too. In this talk I will discuss about performance optimization techniques that leverage homoiconicity.\n<p>\nNo discussion on performance optimization can happen without discussing performance benchmarking. In this talk I will show how to do comparative benchmarking while trying to find performance bottlenecks. I will then proceed to showing techniques on using Clojure's homoiconicity to optimize performance. I will also show how to discover latency breakup of any Clojure code in a waterfall-chart model using homoiconicity.\n\n", "event": {"name": "Functional Conf 2016", "nickname": "functionalconf-2016", "twitter": "fnConf", "url": "http://functionalconf.com/2016/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "performance-optimization-with-code-as-data-in-clojure-by-shantanu-kumar", "length": "50:48", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-10-13", "short_description": "Homoiconicity (code as data, data as code) is one of the hallmarks of Lisp.
