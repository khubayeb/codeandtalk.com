Haskell is a state-of-the-art programming language with immature platform and tooling and no commercial development of its primary implementation. GHCVM's objective is to combine the best of both worlds and reap the benefits.\n<p>\nIn this talk, I will share my journey of how I waded through the internals of GHC and got Haskell and Java to play nice with each other.\n\n", "event": {"name": "Functional Conf 2016", "nickname": "functionalconf-2016", "twitter": "fnConf", "url": "http://functionalconf.com/2016/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "bringing-the-power-of-haskell-to-the-jvm-by-rahul-muttineni-functional-conf-2016", "length": "49:21", "likes": "10", "recorded": "2016-10-13", "short_description": "The JVM is a state-of-the-art, cross-platform virtual machine supported by the vast Java platform and ecosystem, but is cursed w", "speaker_twitters": " @rahulmutt", "speakers": {"rahul-muttineni": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "India", "github": "rahulmutt", "home": "http://typelead.com/", "name": "Rahul Muttineni", "twitter": "rahulmutt"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Functional Conf 2016", "nickname": "functionalconf-2016", "twitter": "fnConf", "url": "http://functionalconf.com/2016/"}, "filename": "bringing-the-power-of-haskell-to-the-jvm-by-rahul-muttineni-functional-conf-2016", "recorded": "2016-10-13", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CscBSNF6qnE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Bringing the Power of Haskell to the JVM"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CscBSNF6qnE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Bringing the Power of Haskell to the JVM", "tweet_video": "Bringing%20the%20Power%20of%20Haskell%20to%20the%20JVM%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/functionalconf-2016/bringing-the-power-of-haskell-to-the-jvm-by-rahul-muttineni-functional-conf-2016%20presented%20%40fnConf%20by%20%40rahulmutt", "videos": [{"code": "CscBSNF6qnE", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "490"}
