Functions as first class objects to express behaviour.\nUsing Builders and Filter predicates for adding new features\nTransforming collections using streams, lambdas, map, reduce, flatMap, groupBy\nOptional for writing null safe code and handling defaults using map, flatMap, orElse\nFunctional operations like partition, zip for simplifying code\nPattern matching and other features from libraries\nCaching and memoization\n\n", "event": {"name": "Functional Conf 2016", "nickname": "functionalconf-2016", "twitter": "fnConf", "url": "http://functionalconf.com/2016/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "real-world-functional-programming-in-ads-serving-by-sathish-kumar", "length": "45:35", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-10-13", "short_description": "This talk will be about how we applied Typed functional programming and object-functional concepts inspired from languages like ", "speaker_twitters": " @sathish316", "speakers": {"sathish-kumar": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "India", "github": "sathish316", "name": "Sathish Kumar", "twitter": "sathish316"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Functional Conf 2016", "nickname": "functionalconf-2016", "twitter": "fnConf", "url": "http://functionalconf.com/2016/"}, "filename": "real-world-functional-programming-in-ads-serving-by-sathish-kumar", "recorded": "2016-10-13", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mOlXKadER6M/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Real world functional programming in Ads serving"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mOlXKadER6M/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Real world functional programming in Ads serving", "tweet_video": "Real%20world%20functional%20programming%20in%20Ads%20serving%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/functionalconf-2016/real-world-functional-programming-in-ads-serving-by-sathish-kumar%20presented%20%40fnConf%20by%20%40sathish316", "videos": [{"code": "mOlXKadER6M", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "239"}
