In this approach of \"nouns-first\" we design object hierarchies using subtyping to model the various elements of the domain. In this talk we will take a different approach using Scala:\n<ol>\n  <li>Start with focus on verbs first.</li>\n  <li>Think how we can model domain behaviors using pure functions grouped within extensible modules.</li>\n  <li>Use an algebraic approach towards evolution of modules,the algebra being composed of functions,types and laws.</li>\n  <li>See how the domain algebra can be constructed from categorical structures like monoids, functors and monads</li>\n  <li>Discuss how the functional patterns lead to compositionality - an extremely important quality that scales your domain model.</li>\n<ol>\n\n", "event": {"name": "Functional Conf 2016", "nickname": "functionalconf-2016", "twitter": "fnConf", "url": "http://functionalconf.com/2016/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "an-algebraic-approach-to-functional-domain-modeling-by-debasish-ghosh-functional-conf-16", "length": "45:22", "likes": "8", "recorded": "2016-10-13", "short_description": "Domain modeling is usually implemented using OO design.
