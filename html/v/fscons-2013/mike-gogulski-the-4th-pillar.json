{"description": "The 4th Pillar\nPeer-to-peer identity and reputation, beyond the state and beyond Bitcoin\n\nMy interpretation of cypherpunk utopia rests on four pillars:\n\n1: Secure messaging. We have that since the early 90s with PGP, etc. Mature.\n\n2: Anonymous messaging. We have that since the last 90s now with Tor. Mature but not widely deployed.\n\n3: Digital bearer currency. We have that now with Bitcoin and its derivatives. Low maturity but rapid innovation.\n\n4: Peer-to-peer identity and reputation. PGP and other systems provide web-of-trust models exist, but so far they don't scale.\n\nReputation and identity today are largely managed by centralized, largely unaccountable entities (states, corporation [think eBay and Equifax]) on the one hand, and by inefficient, low visibility peer networks on the other (old boys' clubs, word-of-mouth). \"Identity\", particularly, is centralized in states facing systematic dissolution.\n\nThe vision is for a decentralized, emergent consensus of reputation and identity. How to implement and live with it is our challenge.", "event": {"name": "FSCONS 2013", "nickname": "fscons-2013", "twitter": "fscons", "url": "https://fscons.org/2013/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "mike-gogulski-the-4th-pillar", "length": "44:19", "likes": "5", "recorded": "2013-11-08", "short_description": "The 4th Pillar Peer-to-peer identity and reputation, beyond the state and beyond Bitcoin My interpretation of cypherpunk utopia ", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0uUTx8m6XfU/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Mike Gogulski: The 4th Pillar", "tweet_video": "Mike%20Gogulski%3A%20The%204th%20Pillar%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/fscons-2013/mike-gogulski-the-4th-pillar%20presented%20%40fscons", "videos": [{"code": "0uUTx8m6XfU", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "150"}
