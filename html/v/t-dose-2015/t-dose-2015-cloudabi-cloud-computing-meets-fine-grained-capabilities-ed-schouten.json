{"description": "<a href=\"https://nuxi.nl/\">CloudABI</a> is a new runtime environment that attempts to make it easier to use UNIX-like operating systems at the core of a cluster/cloud computing platform.\n<p>\nInstead of offering full machine virtualization (e.g., KVM, Xen, bhyve) or requiring the use of intrusive OS-level virtualization techniques (e.g., LXC, FreeBSD Jails, Solaris Zones), end users can simply provide a set of binaries that communicate with the operating system over a secure and compact POSIX-like interface. CloudABI allows you to run untrusted programs directly on top of a UNIX kernel, without compromising security and without requiring complex configuration.\n<p>\nCloudABI makes strong use of capability-based security. Instead of determining the rights of an application through complex ACLs, access to resources is determined by a set of tokens (in this case, file descriptors) that can be altered at run-time. This allows software engineers to harden their software by applying 'defense in depth'.\n<p>\nIn this presentation I will discuss several design aspects of CloudABI and how it can be used to make UNIX software more reliable, more secure and easier to test and deploy.\n\n", "event": {"name": "T-DOSE 2015", "nickname": "t-dose-2015", "twitter": "TDOSE", "url": "http://www.t-dose.org/2015/schedule"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "t-dose-2015-cloudabi-cloud-computing-meets-fine-grained-capabilities-ed-schouten", "length": "51:27", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2015-11-28", "short_description": "CloudABI is a new runtime environment that attempts to make it easier to use UNIX-like operating systems at the core of a cluste", "speaker_twitters": " @EdgarSchouten", "speakers": {"ed-schouten": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "github": "EdgarSchouten", "home": "http://www.reedbusiness.nl/", "name": "Ed Schouten", "twitter": "EdgarSchouten"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "T-DOSE 2015", "nickname": "t-dose-2015", "twitter": "TDOSE", "url": "http://www.t-dose.org/2015/schedule"}, "filename": "t-dose-2015-cloudabi-cloud-computing-meets-fine-grained-capabilities-ed-schouten", "recorded": "2015-11-28", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SgX5pgDuQB0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "CloudABI: Cloud computing meets fine-grained capabilities"}]}}, "tags": [{"link": "cloud", "text": "cloud"}, {"link": "cloudabi", "text": "cloudABI"}], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SgX5pgDuQB0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "CloudABI: Cloud computing meets fine-grained capabilities", "tweet_video": "CloudABI%3A%20Cloud%20computing%20meets%20fine-grained%20capabilities%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/t-dose-2015/t-dose-2015-cloudabi-cloud-computing-meets-fine-grained-capabilities-ed-schouten%20presented%20%40TDOSE%20by%20%40EdgarSchouten%20%23cloud%20%23cloudabi", "videos": [{"code": "SgX5pgDuQB0", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "60"}
