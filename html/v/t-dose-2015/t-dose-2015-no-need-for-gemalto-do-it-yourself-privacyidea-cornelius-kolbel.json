{"description": "Open Source two factor authentication with privacyIDEA\n<p>\nWhen talking of two factor authentication we need to be aware of reliable hardware and the creation of the key material.\n<p>\nMany known hardware vendors use preseeded hardware, which can easily lead to compromized key material. This hardware is often accompanied by closed source software solutions provided by the hardware vendor.\n<p>\nprivacyIDEA is an open source software, which you can run on your own system and use to initialize, manage and authenticate many different kind of authentication devices.\n<p>\nIt is ment to give you full control over your authentication process, your accounts and your data. It can be used with standard software using common protocols like RADIUS and PAM and utilizing the lean REST API you can integrate it into your own web applications easily.\n<p>\nThis talk gives you an overview over the features and current development ideas.\n\n", "event": {"name": "T-DOSE 2015", "nickname": "t-dose-2015", "twitter": "TDOSE", "url": "http://www.t-dose.org/2015/schedule"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "t-dose-2015-no-need-for-gemalto-do-it-yourself-privacyidea-cornelius-kolbel", "length": "01:02:26", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2015-11-28", "short_description": "Open Source two factor authentication with privacyIDEA When talking of two factor authentication we need to be aware of reliable", "speaker_twitters": " @cornelinux", "speakers": {"cornelius-kolbel": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "Germany", "github": "cornelinux", "home": "https://netknights.it/", "name": "Cornelius K\u00f6lbel", "twitter": "cornelinux"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "T-DOSE 2015", "nickname": "t-dose-2015", "twitter": "TDOSE", "url": "http://www.t-dose.org/2015/schedule"}, "filename": "t-dose-2015-no-need-for-gemalto-do-it-yourself-privacyidea-cornelius-kolbel", "recorded": "2015-11-28", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i29OzV6ICII/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "No need for Gemalto, Do it yourself!, privacyIDEA"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i29OzV6ICII/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "No need for Gemalto, Do it yourself!, privacyIDEA", "tweet_video": "No%20need%20for%20Gemalto%2C%20Do%20it%20yourself%21%2C%20privacyIDEA%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/t-dose-2015/t-dose-2015-no-need-for-gemalto-do-it-yourself-privacyidea-cornelius-kolbel%20presented%20%40TDOSE%20by%20%40cornelinux", "videos": [{"code": "i29OzV6ICII", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "198"}
