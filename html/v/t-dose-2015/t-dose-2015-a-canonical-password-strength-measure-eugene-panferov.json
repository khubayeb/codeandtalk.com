{"description": "We notice that the \"password security\" discourse is missing a fundamental notion of the \"password strength\".\n<p>\nWe propose a canonical measure of password's strength.\nWe give formal definition of the \"guessing attack\", and the \"attacker's strategy\".\nThe measure is based on the assessment of the efficiency of the best possible guessing attack.\nUnlike naive password strength assessments our measure takes into account the attacker's strategy.\nWe argue strongly against widespread informal assumptions about \"strong\" and \"weak\" passwords, and advise to adopt formal metrics such as proposed one.\nThis paper does NOT advise you to include at least three capital letters, seven underscores, and a number thirteen in your password.\n\nFull text of the paper is on <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05090\">arXiv</a> available as PDF and TeX.\n\n", "event": {"name": "T-DOSE 2015", "nickname": "t-dose-2015", "twitter": "TDOSE", "url": "http://www.t-dose.org/2015/schedule"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "t-dose-2015-a-canonical-password-strength-measure-eugene-panferov", "length": "46:57", "likes": "9", "recorded": "2015-11-28", "short_description": "We notice that the password security discourse is missing a fundamental notion of the password strength.
