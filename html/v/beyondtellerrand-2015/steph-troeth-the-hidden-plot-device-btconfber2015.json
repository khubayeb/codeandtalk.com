But is this all there is?\n\nUnconvinced that storytelling could be so superficial, Steph spent a few years learning from the art of making documentaries, crime fiction, novels and the shortest of stories. As she uncovered the parallels in the making of stories and the research/design processes of UX, she began to formulate a framework where these two worlds meet, unearthing a different angle on what do in order to take our skills to greater heights.\n\nIn this session, Steph will show how understanding the essence and practice of story opens a world of possibilities and adds another dimension to your UX toolset. Better still, it\u2019s less of a mystery than what you might think.\n---------------\n\nTalk & speaker bio:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2015/speakers/stephanie-troeth\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nWatch this little recap video to get an impression how beyond tellerrand events look like:\nhttp://vimeo.com/69823900\n\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nhttp://beyondtellerrand.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/btconf", "event": {"name": "Beyond Tellerrand 2015", "nickname": "beyondtellerrand-2015", "twitter": "btconf", "url": "https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2015"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-31", "filename": "steph-troeth-the-hidden-plot-device-btconfber2015", "length": "42:49", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2015-05-11", "short_description": "Description: --------------- \u201cStorytelling appears to be a magic word when it comes to creating user experience\u2014we use it to evo", "speaker_twitters": " @sniffles", "speakers": {"stephanie-troeth": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"country": "London, UK", "home": "https://about.me/stephtroeth", "name": "Stephanie Troeth", "twitter": "sniffles"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Beyond Tellerrand 2015", "nickname": "beyondtellerrand-2015", "twitter": "btconf", "url": "https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2015"}, "filename": "steph-troeth-the-hidden-plot-device-btconfber2015", "recorded": "2015-05-11", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sLUml3NnQwM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Hidden Plot Device"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sLUml3NnQwM/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "The Hidden Plot Device", "tweet_video": "The%20Hidden%20Plot%20Device%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/beyondtellerrand-2015/steph-troeth-the-hidden-plot-device-btconfber2015%20presented%20%40btconf%20by%20%40sniffles", "videos": [{"code": "sLUml3NnQwM", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "63"}
