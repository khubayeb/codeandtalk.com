{"description": "Ruby and frameworks based on that are not just for scripting and web development. Ruby can be used to build telephony/voice apps which, on one hand, can talk to humans over regular phone calls and on the other, interact with any external service (including your Rails app). You can imagine how powerful this can be to build voice enabled apps with nothing more than your existing Ruby skills. If you ever wondered how they build all the IVR systems, it's time to stop wondering and start building one, right now !\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce the audience to an open source framework called Adhearsion which is written in pure Ruby and allows you, the Ruby developer to integrate with telephony services like FreeSWITCH, Asterisk etc and also your existing Ruby/Rails app to build great, voice enabled services with very little effort and learning curve.", "event": {"name": "RubyConf India 2014", "nickname": "rubyconf-india-2014", "twitter": "rubyconfindia", "url": "https://github.com/rubyconfindia/rci2014"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "make-ruby-talk-to-your-users-literally-bhavin-javia", "length": "30:35", "likes": "2", "recorded": "2014-03-22", "short_description": "Ruby and frameworks based on that are not just for scripting and web development.
