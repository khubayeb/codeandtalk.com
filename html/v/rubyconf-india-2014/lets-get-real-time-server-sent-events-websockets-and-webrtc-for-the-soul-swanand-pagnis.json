{"description": "When it comes to delivering a fast, near real-time UX, the traditional AJAX techniques have several short-comings. Polling creates additional HTTP overhead, is prone to latency issues and long polling is at best a hack. And don't we all love hate hacks!\nWith Server Sent Events, you can push data to the app whenever it's available, WebSockets are in fact bi-directional, full-duplex.\nWith this understanding, we will look at Server-Sent Events, WebSockets & WebRTC from a browser and server perspective. We will also look at all pieces we need to fit in, to get the big picture.\n\nAgenda\n\nConcepts and app Integration with:\nServer Sent Events\nWebSockets\nWebRTC\nRelated Open Source projects\nFurther reading, and opportunities to contribute and create\nHopefully questions\nKey Takeaways\n\nYou will:\n\nLearn the involved concepts\nSee relevant code from popular open source projects\nKnow where to look for further reading\nHave fun!", "event": {"name": "RubyConf India 2014", "nickname": "rubyconf-india-2014", "twitter": "rubyconfindia", "url": "https://github.com/rubyconfindia/rci2014"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "lets-get-real-time-server-sent-events-websockets-and-webrtc-for-the-soul-swanand-pagnis", "length": "31:29", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2014-03-22", "short_description": "When it comes to delivering a fast, near real-time UX, the traditional AJAX techniques have several short-comings.
