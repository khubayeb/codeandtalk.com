{"description": "The Metasploit Framework (MSF) happens to be the largest ruby project and suprisingly enough, not many rubyists seem to know about this project, but it means the world to those who use this framework - the Penetration Testers.\n\nThis session would cover a component of MSF called Meterpreter. Meterpreter is an advanced payload which uses DLL injection to hook into an existing live process on the remote system. It provides a remote shell which can be used to run scripted attacks or to gather information from the victim host.\n\nWith some simple ruby code and the shell provided by meterpreter, I shall demonstrate gathering restricted information from a victim host post-exploitation.\n\nNote: This session could be thought of as a follow-up of my previous session titled \"Pelting Rubies\" at RubyConf India 2013.", "event": {"name": "RubyConf India 2014", "nickname": "rubyconf-india-2014", "twitter": "rubyconfindia", "url": "https://github.com/rubyconfindia/rci2014"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "offensive-ruby-ausmarton-fernandes", "length": "23:43", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2014-03-22", "short_description": "The Metasploit Framework (MSF) happens to be the largest ruby project and suprisingly enough, not many rubyists seem to know abo", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2fpHRh28ZlE/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Offensive Ruby - Ausmarton Fernandes", "tweet_video": "Offensive%20Ruby%20-%20Ausmarton%20Fernandes%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/rubyconf-india-2014/offensive-ruby-ausmarton-fernandes%20presented%20%40rubyconfindia", "videos": [{"code": "2fpHRh28ZlE", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "88"}
