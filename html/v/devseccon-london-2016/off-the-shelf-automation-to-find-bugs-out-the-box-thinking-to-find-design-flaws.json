{"description": "During this session we will share some of the most interesting and thought-provoking of the high profile public domain hacks. As the session progresses, attendees will start to pre-empt the potential flaws in the setups described, eventually finding would-be \u201c0-day flaws\u201d in the software described with minimal prompting \u2013 thus proving that it\u2019s possible to pre-empt and resolve issues well before writing them and then working out how to test for them. If your previous exposure was primarily the OWASP Top 10, this session will be a real eye-opener into the rich and diverse range of creative hacks out there, many of which have little to do with the Top 10 and will drastically improve your creative and destructive thinking when developing your own applications.", "event": {"name": "DevSecCon London 2016", "nickname": "devseccon-london-2016", "twitter": "devseccon", "url": "http://www.devseccon.com/london-2016/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-30", "filename": "off-the-shelf-automation-to-find-bugs-out-the-box-thinking-to-find-design-flaws", "length": "27:22", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-10-20", "short_description": "During this session we will share some of the most interesting and thought-provoking of the high profile public domain hacks.
