{"description": "Who wants a mindless drone? Teach it to think, and it can do so much more. But how do you take it from Toy Story to Terminator? This session\u2019s speaker discusses a new open source library, Autonomous4j, for autonomous drone development. Combining this library and some components from his mad science toolkit, he demonstrates how to get your Internet of Things off the ground and do some real cloud computing. In the session, you\u2019ll learn how to write an autonomous drone program with Java 8; deploy it to the drone\u2019s positronic brain, an onboard Raspberry Pi; have the Pi guide an AR.Drone to accomplish a task; monitor it via a JavaFX console; and create your own robot overlord. Demos are included: you\u2019ve been warned! This presentation will feature an AR Drone flying autonomously\n\n\nAuthor:\nJames Weaver\nJames L.
