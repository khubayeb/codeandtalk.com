{"description": "Dynamically optimized environments present unique challenges for trading systems, and for many other systems where consistent speed is required. Dynamic optimizations give us faster code, but can also bring temporary slowdowns, often at the worst possible times. After GC complaints, the most common issues we hear about in Java-based trading systems have to do with \"warmup\" behavior and de-optimization slowdowns. These seem to predictably hit just as the market opens, resulting in slow trades when speed matters most.In this talk, Gil Tene (CTO, Azul Systems) will provide an overview of JIT compiler optimization techniques and their impact on common market-open slowdown scenarios. Gil will cover the technical issues behind such slowdowns, and discuss new techniques that may be used to avoid them, including the use of features specifically built to tame the JVM and improve behavior at market open.\n\n\nAuthor:\n Gil Tene\nGil Tene is CTO and co-founder of Azul Systems. He has been involved with virtual machine and runtime technologies for the past 25 years. His pet focus areas include system responsiveness and latency behavior. Gil is a frequent speaker at technology conferences worldwide, and an official JavaOne Rock Star. He pioneered the Continuously Concurrent Compacting Collector (C4) that powers Azul's continuously responsive Java platforms. In past lives, he also designed and built operating systems, network switches, firewalls, and laser based mosquito interception systems. @giltene", "event": {"name": "Devoxx France 2015", "nickname": "devoxx-france-2015", "twitter": "DevoxxFR", "url": "https://www.devoxx.fr/2015/index.html"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "priming-java-for-speed", "length": "52:19", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-06-08", "short_description": "Dynamically optimized environments present unique challenges for trading systems, and for many other systems where consistent sp", "speaker_twitters": "", "speakers": {}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YVJ8LWQ470I/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Priming Java for Speed", "tweet_video": "Priming%20Java%20for%20Speed%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/devoxx-france-2015/priming-java-for-speed%20presented%20%40DevoxxFR", "videos": [{"code": "YVJ8LWQ470I", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "154"}
