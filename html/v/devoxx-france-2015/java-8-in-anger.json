{"description": "Java 9 is just around the corner, and yet many of us developers have yet to use Java 8 features in an application. The goal of this presentation is to move beyond slide-sized examples of streams and lambdas, and to show how to build a fully working end-to-end application using just the core libraries available in the latest version of Java.In this session, Trisha will build a Java 8 application live. This application will consume a real-time feed of high velocity data, contain services that make sense of the data, and present it in a JavaFX dashboard. Along the way, we\u2019ll encounter Java 8 streams, lambdas, new ways of working with collections, and probably bump into the new date and time API.\n\n\nAuthor:\nTrisha Gee\nTrisha has developed Java applications for a range of industries, including finance, manufacturing and non-profit, for companies of all sizes.
