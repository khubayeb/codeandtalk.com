{"description": "Reactive Extensions have been around for quite a while. First originated in the Microsoft space, they are now available pretty much on any language and platform, including Java and JavaScript. In this session we\u2019re going to understand what reactive extensions are all about and how we can leverage them to create asynchronous and scalable applications. We\u2019ll see the benefits they provide over other more traditional asynchronous models and see how to put them to use with practical examples. This session is about finally understanding Rx and removing all the myth surrounding it.\n\n\nAuthor:\nHadi Hariri\nHadi Hariri is a developer, speaker, podcaster and Technical Evangelist at JetBrains.
