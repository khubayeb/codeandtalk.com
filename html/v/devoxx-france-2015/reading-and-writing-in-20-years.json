{"description": "Information is the  I  in IT. Arguably, the most important topic in human civilization. What's reading and writing going to be like in 20 years? Will we all be communicating in Mandarin, English or Emoji? Will plain text formats be king or will we still be fighting with WYSIWYG editors? The fate of civilization could be in our hands...or rather, our editors.\n\n\nAuthor:\n Dan Allen\nDan is an open source advocate, community catalyst, developer, published author (Seam in Action) and internationally recognized speaker. He is the lead of the Asciidoctor project (asciidoctor.org), serves as the strategic advisor for Arquillian (arquillian.org) and helps promote the JVM as a polyglot Java Champion.\n\nAs one of the founders of OpenDevise, Dan works with software communities and businesses to help them discover and cultivate their open source way. (Is there any other way?)\n\nAfter a long conference day, you'll likely find Dan enjoying chatting about tech, docs and open source with fellow community members over a Trappist beer or Kentucky Bourbon.", "event": {"name": "Devoxx France 2015", "nickname": "devoxx-france-2015", "twitter": "DevoxxFR", "url": "https://www.devoxx.fr/2015/index.html"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "reading-and-writing-in-20-years", "length": "17:06", "likes": "0", "recorded": "2016-06-08", "short_description": "Information is the I in IT.
