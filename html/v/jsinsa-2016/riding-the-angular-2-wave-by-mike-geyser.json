{"description": "The imminent release of Angular 2 is poised like a tsunami, ready to take the World Wide Web by storm, and will inevitably drag the entire JavaScript ecosystem along for the ride.\nAngular 2 sees itself less as a framework, and more as a platform on which to craft your single page applications.\nThis session will uncover the cornerstone of an angular application by illustrating the new web-component based design, improved dependency injection, and unidirectional data flow.\nIt will also demonstrate the routing model, templating and practical debugging.\nEverything needed to kick start a project, and start riding the Angular 2 wave.\n<p>\nSpeaker Bio:\n<p>\nMike Geyser is a programmer at BBD, specialising in designing and building for the web platform.\nHe's been hacking on the web since geocities was a thing, has a long-lived love affair with javascript, and has (almost) come to terms with the fact that he will never have a programmer beard.\nWhile he has worked on some interesting large-scale enterprise applications, it is the challenges of the public web that really appeals to him - having earned his stripes on high volume transactional websites.\nHe works primarily in javascript, C# and (unfortunately) java, and seldom refers to himself in the third person.\n\n", "event": {"name": "jsinsa - JavaScript in South Africa 2016", "nickname": "jsinsa-2016", "twitter": "jsinsa", "url": "http://www.jsinsa.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "riding-the-angular-2-wave-by-mike-geyser", "length": "31:00", "likes": "2", "recorded": "2016-07-16", "short_description": "The imminent release of Angular 2 is poised like a tsunami, ready to take the World Wide Web by storm, and will inevitably drag ", "speaker_twitters": " @mikegeyser", "speakers": {"mike-geyser": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"github": "mikegeyser", "name": "Mike Geyser", "twitter": "mikegeyser"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "jsinsa - JavaScript in South Africa 2016", "nickname": "jsinsa-2016", "twitter": "jsinsa", "url": "http://www.jsinsa.com/"}, "filename": "riding-the-angular-2-wave-by-mike-geyser", "recorded": "2016-07-16", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yMb8vcJcS-s/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Riding the Angular 2 wave"}]}}, "tags": [], "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yMb8vcJcS-s/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Riding the Angular 2 wave", "tweet_video": "Riding%20the%20Angular%202%20wave%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/jsinsa-2016/riding-the-angular-2-wave-by-mike-geyser%20presented%20%40jsinsa%20by%20%40mikegeyser", "videos": [{"code": "yMb8vcJcS-s", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "156"}
