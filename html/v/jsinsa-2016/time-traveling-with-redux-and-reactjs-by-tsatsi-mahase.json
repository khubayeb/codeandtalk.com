{"description": "One of the biggest challenges faced with single page applications is keeping state. Seemingly basic tasks such as undoing an action or navigating through an application while retaining state may suddenly require non trivial effort.\n<p>\nHow do we manage the ever changing state?  How do we ensure that our state mutations are predictable?\n<p>\nIn this talk we will build a stateful application with redux and Reactjs that enables us to time travel by moving backward and forward in time through our application state. We will see how redux makes life easy and explore tools and resources to add to our toolboxes.\n<p>\nSpeaker bio:\n<p>\nTsatsi Mahase is a Software Developer at Thoughtworks.\nHe studied Computer Systems Engineering and is passionate about programming.\nHe has special interest in front end development which includes mobile and web application development.\nWhen he's not programming or learning something new, he spends most of his time sharing his knowledge.\n", "event": {"name": "jsinsa - JavaScript in South Africa 2016", "nickname": "jsinsa-2016", "twitter": "jsinsa", "url": "http://www.jsinsa.com/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "time-traveling-with-redux-and-reactjs-by-tsatsi-mahase", "length": "19:02", "likes": "4", "recorded": "2016-07-16", "short_description": "One of the biggest challenges faced with single page applications is keeping state.
