{"description": "Presenting speaker, Dan Wilson\n\nWe've enjoyed CSS transitions and animations for a few years now, with their broad support and ability to latch onto hardware acceleration. Now the Web Animations API is coming (and already polyfilled!), so what does this let us do through JavaScript?\n\nThrough several examples, we will take a look at how this new JavaScript API came to be and how it compares to what has come before it. Most importantly, we will work through its added benefits like timelines, controls, and its dynamic nature.\n\nhttp://frontporch.io/resource/", "event": {"name": "Front Porch Austin 2016", "nickname": "frontporch-austin-2016", "twitter": "frontporchio", "url": "http://frontporch.io/austin/"}, "favorite": "0", "file_date": "2016-12-03", "filename": "fun-with-the-web-animations-api", "length": "33:07", "likes": "1", "recorded": "2016-07-19", "short_description": "Presenting speaker, Dan Wilson We've enjoyed CSS transitions and animations for a few years now, with their broad support and ab", "speaker_twitters": " @dancwilson", "speakers": {"dan-wilson": {"episodes": [], "hosting": [], "info": {"home": "http://danielcwilson.com/", "name": "Dan Wilson", "twitter": "dancwilson"}, "videos": [{"event": {"name": "Front Porch Austin 2016", "nickname": "frontporch-austin-2016", "twitter": "frontporchio", "url": "http://frontporch.io/austin/"}, "filename": "fun-with-the-web-animations-api", "recorded": "2016-07-19", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l371Y04kXf0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Fun with the Web Animations API"}]}}, "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l371Y04kXf0/hqdefault.jpg", "title": "Fun with the Web Animations API", "tweet_video": "Fun%20with%20the%20Web%20Animations%20API%20https%3A//codeandtalk.com/v/frontporch-austin-2016/fun-with-the-web-animations-api%20presented%20%40frontporchio%20by%20%40dancwilson", "videos": [{"code": "l371Y04kXf0", "type": "youtube"}], "views": "93"}
